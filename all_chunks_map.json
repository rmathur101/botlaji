THE NETWORK STATE IN ONE SENTENCE 9\nBut what exactly isa network state?", "num_tokens": 495}, "1": {"document": "1.2 The Network State in One Sentence\nIn one informal sentence:\nA network state is a highly aligned online community with a capacity for\ncollective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually\ngains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states.\nWhen we think of a nation state, we immediately think of the lands, but when we think\nof a network state, we should instantly think of the minds. That is, if the nation state\nsystem starts with the map of the globe and assigns each patch of land to a single state,\nthe network state system starts with the 7+ billion humans of the world and attracts\neach mind to one or more networks.\nHere\u2019s a more complex de\ufb01nition that extends that concept and pre-emptively covers\nmany edge cases:\nA network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of na-\ntional consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action,\nanin-personlevelofcivility, anintegratedcryptocurrency, aconsensualgov-\nernment limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded\nphysical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves\na large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a\nmeasure of diplomatic recognition.\nOK, that\u2019s a mouthful! It\u2019s lengthy because there are many internet phenomena that\nsharesomebutnotallofthepropertiesofanetworkstate. Forexample, neitherBitcoin\nnor Facebook nor a DAO is a network state, because each lacks certain qualities \u2013 like\ndiplomatic recognition \u2013 which are core to anything we\u2019d think of as the next version\nof the nation state.\n(If you want to skip ahead, we expand on each part of the de\ufb01nition in Chapter 5. But\nit\u2019ll make more sense if you read the text all the way through. For what it\u2019s worth,\nthe technical de\ufb01nition of a nation state is similarly multi-clausal, because it needs to\nexclude things we don\u2019t typically think about, like stateless nations.)10 CHAPTER 1.

Speci\ufb01cally, it depicts a network state with 1.7 million people, more\nthan 157 billion dollars in annual income, and a 136 million square meter footprint.\nThe \ufb01rst thing we notice is that a network state isn\u2019t physically centralized like a\nnation state, nor limited in scale like a city state. It\u2019s geographically decentralized and\nconnected by the internet.\nThe second thing we see is that you could feasibly start this kind of country from your\ncomputer. That is, just as Facebook grew from one person\u2019s laptop, a million-person\nnetwork state that owns a global archipelago of physical territory could start as a\none-person startup society, as shown in this gif: thenetworkstate.com/networkstate.gif.\nThe third thing we see is how central the real-time census is to the network state. The\ndashboard shown combines concepts from coins, companies, and countries to focus a\nsociety on growthin people, annual income, and real estate footprint.\nContinued growth is a continuous plebiscite, a vote of con\ufb01dence by the people inside\nwho remain and those outside who apply.

Because we want to build something new without historical constraint.\nThe \ufb01nancial demand for a clean slate is clear.

We will introduce them only to deprioritize them all in favor of a\nseventh.\n1. Election\nThe most conventional way to start a new country involves winning su\ufb03cient power\nin an election to either (a) rewrite the laws of an existing state or (b) carve out a new\none from scratch with the recognition of the international community. This is the most\nwidely discussed path, and by far the most crowded \u2014 perhaps toocrowded.\n2. Revolution\nThe second obvious way is a political revolution. We don\u2019t advise attempting this.\nParticularly momentous elections are sometimes referred to as revolutions, though a\nrevolution frequently involves bloodshed. Revolutions are infrequent, but everyone\nknows that they mean a new government.\n3. War\nThe third conventional way to form a new state is to win a war. We don\u2019t advise\nattempting this either. A war is, of course, not independent from the other two.14 CHAPTER 1. QUICKSTART\nIndeed, both elections and revolutions can lead to wars that end up carving out new\npolities. Like a revolution, a war is infrequent and undesirable, but is a means by which\nto redraw state borders.\n4. Micronations\nNow we get to the unconventional. The most obvious of the unconventional approaches\n\u2013 and the one most people think of when they hear the concept of \u201cstarting a new\ncountry\u201d \u2013 occurs when an eccentric plants a \ufb02ag on an o\ufb00shore platform or disputed\npatch of dirt and declares themselves king of nothing. If the issue with elections is that\ntoomanypeople care about them, the issue with these so-called micronations is that\ntoofewpeople care. Because a state (like a currency) is an inherently social a\ufb00air, a\nfew people in the middle of nowhere won\u2019t be able to organize a military, enforce laws,\nor be recognized by other countries. Moreover, while an existing state may be content\nto let people harmlesslyLARP a fake country in their backyard, an actual threat to\nsovereignty typically produces a response with real guns, whether that be the Falklands\nor Sakhalin.\n5. Seasteading\nHere is where things start to get interesting. Conceived by Patri Friedman and backed\nby Peter Thiel, seasteading essentially starts with the observation that cruise ships\nexist, and asks whether we could move from a few weeks on the water at a time to\nsemi-permanent habitation in international waters (with frequent docking, of course).\nIfthe costofcruiseshipsfalls, this approach becomesmore feasible. Butwhilethere are\nindividuals who live on cruise ships year-round, we haven\u2019t yet seen a scaled example.\n6. Space\nPerhaps the most prestigious of the start-a-new-country paths is the idea of colonizing\nother planets. Unlike seasteading or micronations, space exploration started at the\ngovernment level and has been glamorized in many movies and TV shows, so it enjoys\na higher degree of social acceptability. This path is typically received as temporarily\ntechnically infeasible, rather than outright crazy. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX is one entity\nseriously contemplating the logistics of starting a new state on Mars.1.5. THE NETWORK STATE IN ONE ESSAY 15\n7. Network States\nAnd\ufb01nallywearriveatourpreferredmethod: thenetworkstate. Ourideaistoproceed\ncloud \ufb01rst, land last. Rather than starting with the physical territory, we start with\nthe digital community. We create a startup society, organize it into a network union,\ncrowdfund the physical nodes of a network archipelago, and \u2014 in the fullness of time\n\u2014 eventually negotiate for diplomatic recognition to become a true network state. We\nbuild the embryonic state as an open-source project, we organize our internal economy\naround remote work, we cultivate in-person levels of civility, we simulate architecture\nin VR, and we create art and literature that re\ufb02ects our values.\nWhen we crowdfund territory in the real world, it\u2019s not necessarily contiguous territory.\nBecause an under-appreciated fact is that the internet allows us to network enclaves .\nPut another way, a network archipelago need not acquire all its territory in one place\nat one time. It can connect a thousand apartments, a hundred houses, and a dozen cul-\nde-sacs in di\ufb00erent cities into a new kind of fractal polity with its capital in the cloud.\nCommunity members migrate between these enclaves and crowdfund territory nearby,\nwith every individual dwelling and group house presenting an independent opportunity\nfor expansion. And with a thousand such enclaves, rather than four directions to\nexpand (north, east, south, and west), there are more like four thousand.\nWhat we\u2019ve described thus far is much like an ethnic diaspora, in which emigrants are\ninternationally dispersed but connected by communication channels with each other\nand the motherland. The twist is that our version is a reverse diaspora : a community\nthat forms \ufb01rst on the internet, builds a culture online, and only then comes together\nin-person to build dwellings and structures. In a sense, you can think of each physical\noutpost of this digital community as a cloud embassy , similar to the grassroots Bitcoin\nembassies that have arisen around the world to help people better understand Bitcoin.\nNew recruits can visit either the virtual or physical parts of a network state, beta test\nit, and decide to leave or stay.\nNow, with all this talk of embassies and countries one might well contend that network\nstates, like the aforementioned micronations, are also just a LARP. Unlike microna-\ntions, however, they are set up to be a scaledLARP, a feat of imagination practiced\nby large numbers of people at the same time.

The main di\ufb00erence between the seventh\nmethod (network states) and the previous six (election, revolution, war, micronations,\nseasteading, and space) is that the seventh straddles the boundary between practicality\nand impracticality.\nIt is now feasible to build million-person online communities, start billion-dollar digital\ncurrencies, and architect buildings in VR to then crowdfund into reality.

By 2020 it had\nchanged the trajectory of the People\u2019s Bank of China, the IMF, Goldman Sachs, JP\nMorgan, and the World Bank.

Founding a startup society as we\u2019ve described it seems to be about\ngrowing a community, writing code, crowdfunding land, and eventually attaining the\ndiplomatic recognition to become a network state. What does history have to do with\nanything?\nThe short version is that if a tech company is about technological innovation \ufb01rst, and\ncompany culture second, a startup society is the reverse. It\u2019s about community culture\n\ufb01rst, and technological innovation second. And while innovating on technology means\nforecasting the future, innovating on culture means probing the past.\nBut why? Well, for a tech company like SpaceX you start with time-invariant laws of\nphysics extracted from data, laws that tell you how atoms collide andinteract with each\nother. The study of these laws allows you to do something that has never been done\nbefore, seemingly proving that history doesn\u2019t matter. But the subtlety is that these\nlaws of physics encode in highly compressed form the results of innumerable scienti\ufb01c\nexperiments. You are learning from human experience rather than trying to re-derive\nphysical law from scratch. To touch Mars, we stand on the shoulders of giants.\nFor a startup society, we don\u2019t yet have eternal mathematical laws for society.History\nis the closest thing we have to a physics of humanity. It furnishes many accounts of how\nhuman actors collide and interact with each other. The right course of historical study\nencodes, in compressed form, the results of innumerable social experiments. You can\nlearn from human experience rather than re-deriving societal law from scratch. Learn\nsome history, so as not to repeat it.\n1920 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nThat\u2019s a theoretical argument. An observational argument is that we know that the\ntechnological innovation of the Renaissance began by rediscovering history. And we\nknowthattheFoundingFatherscareddeeplyabouthistory. Inbothcases,theystepped\nforward by drawing from the past. So if you\u2019re a technologist looking to blaze a trail\nwith a new startup society, that establishes plausibility for why historical study is\nimportant.\nThe logistical argument is perhaps the most compelling. Think about how much easier\nit is to use an iPhone than it was to build Apple from scratch. To consume you can just\nclick a button, but to produce it\u2019s necessary to know something about how companies\narebuilt. Similarly, it\u2019sonethingtooperateasamerecitizenofapre-builtcountry, and\nquite another thing to create one from scratch.

And this again brings us into the domain of history.", "num_tokens": 637}, "10": {"document": "2.1.1 Why History is Crucial\nYou can\u2019t really learn something without using it. One day of immersion with a new\nlanguage beats weeks of book learning. One day of trying to build something with a\nprogramming language beats weeks of theory, too.\nIn the same way, the history we teach is an appliedhistory: a crucial tool for both\nthe prospective president of a startup societyand for their citizens, shareholders, and\nsta\ufb00. It\u2019s something you\u2019ll use on a daily basis. Why?\n\u2022History is how you win the argument. Think about the 1619 Project, or the\ngrievance studies departments at universities, or even a newspaper \u201cpro\ufb01le\u201d of\nsome unfortunate. You might be mining cryptocurrency, but the folks behind\nsuch things are mining history. That is, many thousands of people are engaged\nfull time in \u201co\ufb00ense archaeology,\u201d the excavation of the recent and distant past\nfor some useful incident they can write up to further demoralize their political\nopposition. This is the scholarly version of going through someone\u2019s old tweets.\nIt\u2019s weaponized history, history as opposition research. You simply can\u2019t win an\nargument against such people on pure logic alone; you need facts, so you need\nhistory.\n\u2022History determines legality. Wedenotetheexponentialimprovementintransistor\ndensity over the postwar period by Moore\u2019s law. We describe the exponential\ndeclinein pharmaceutical R&D e\ufb03ciency during the same period as Eroom\u2019s\nlaw \u2014 as Moore\u2019s law in reverse. That is, over the last several decades, the FDA2.1. PROLOGUE 21\nsomehow presided over an enormous hike in the costs of drug development even as\nour computers and our knowledge of the human genome vastly improved. Similar\nphenomena can be observed in energy (where energy production has stagnated),\nin aviation (where top speeds have topped out), and in construction (where we\nbuild slower today than we did seventy years ago).\nObviously, even articulating Eroom\u2019s law requires detailed knowledge of history,\nknowledge of how things used to be. Less obviously, if we want to change Eroom\u2019s\nlaw, if we want to innovate in the physical world again, we\u2019ll need history too.\nThe reason is that behind every FDA is a thalidomide, just as behind every TSA\nthere\u2019s a 9/11 and behind every Sarbanes-Oxley is an Enron. Regulation is dull,\nbut the incidents that lead to regulation are anything but dull.\nThis history is used to defend ancient regulations; if you change them, people\nwill die! As such, to legalize physical innovation you\u2019ll need to become a counter-\nhistorian. Only when you understand the legitimating history of regulatory agen-\ncies better than their proponents do can you build a superior alternative: a new\nregulatory paradigm capable of addressing both the abuses of the American reg-\nulatory state andthe abuses they claim to prevent.\n\u2022History determines morality. Religions start with history lessons. You might\nthink of these as made-up histories, but they\u2019re histories all the same. Tales of\nthe distant past, \ufb01ctionalized or not, that describe how humans once behaved -\nand how they should have behaved. There\u2019s a moral to these stories.\nPolitical doctrines are based on history lessons too. They\u2019re how the establish-\nment justi\ufb01es itself. The mechanism for propagating these history lessons is the\nestablishment newspaper, wherein most articles aren\u2019t really about true-or-false,\nbut good-and-bad. Try it yourself. Just by glancing at a headline from any es-\ntablishment outlet, you can instantly apprehend its moral lesson: x-ism is bad,\nour system of government is good, tech founders are bad, and so on. And if you\npoke one level deeper, if you ask whyany of these things is good or bad, you\u2019ll\nagain get a history lesson. Because why is x-ism bad? Well, let me educateyou\non some history...\nThe installation of these moral premises is a zero-sum game. There\u2019s only room\nfor so many moral lessons in one society, because a brain\u2019s capacity for moral\ncomputation is limited. So you get a totally di\ufb00erent society if 99% of people\nallocate their limited moral memory to principles like \u201chard work good, meri-\ntocracy good, envy bad, charity good\u201d than if 99% of people have internalized\nnostrums like \u201csocialism good, civility bad, law enforcement bad, looting good.\u201d\nYou can try to imagine a scenario where these two sets of moral values aren\u2019t in\ndirect con\ufb02ict, but empirically those with the \ufb01rst set of moral values will favor22 CHAPTER 2.

You can make up entirely \ufb01ctional\nstories, of course. But even \ufb01ction frequently has some kind of historical an-\ntecedent. The Lord of the Rings drew on Medieval Europe, Spaghetti Westerns\npulled from the Wild West, Bond movies were inspired by the Cold War, and\nso on. And certainly the legitimating stories for any political order will draw on\nhistory.\n\u2022History is the true value of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is worth hundreds of billions\nof dollars because it\u2019s a cryptographically veri\ufb01able history of who holds what\nBTC. Read The Truth Machine for a book-length treatment of this concept.\n\u2022History tells you who\u2019s in charge. Why did Orwell say that he who controls the\npast controls the future, and that he who controls the present controls the past?\nBecause history textbooks are written by the winners. They are authored, sub-\ntly or not, to tell a story of great triumph by the ruling establishment over its\npast enemies. The only history most people in the US know is 1776, 1865, 1945,\nand 1965 - a potted history of revolutions, world wars, and activist movements\nthat lead ineluctably to the sunny uplands of greater political equality.It\u2019s very\nsimilar to the history the Soviets taught their children, where all of the past\nwas interpreted through the lens of class struggle, bringing Soviet citizens to the\npresent day where they were inevitably progressing from the intermediate stage\nof socialism towards...communism! Chinese schoolchildren learn a similarly se-\nlective history where the (real) wrongs of the European colonialists and Japanese\nare centered, and those of Mao downplayed. And even any successful startup\ntells a founding story that sands o\ufb00 the rough edges.\nInshort, ahistorytextbookgivesyouahero\u2019sjourneythatcelebratesthetriumph\nof its establishment authors against all odds. Even when a historical treatment\ncovers ostensible victims, like Soviet textbooks covering the victimization of the\nproletariat, if you look carefully the ruling class that authors that treatment\ntypically justi\ufb01es itself as the champion of those victims. This is why one of the\n\ufb01rst acts of any conquering regime is to rewrite the textbooks (click those links),\nto tell you who\u2019s in charge.\n\u2022History determines your hiring policy. Why are tech companies being lectured by\nmediacorporationson\u201cdiversity\u201d? Isitbecausethosemediacorporationsthatare\n20-30 points whiter than tech companies actually deeply care about this? Or is\nit because after the 2009-era collapse of print media revenue, media corporations\nstruggled for a business model, found that certain words drove tra\ufb03c, and then\ndoubled down on that - boosting their stock price and bashing their competitors2.1. PROLOGUE 23\nin the process?After all, if you know a bit morehistory, you\u2019ll know that the\nNew York Times Company (which originates so many of these jeremiads) is an\norganization where the controlling Ochs-Sulzberger family literally pro\ufb01ted from\nslavery, blocked women from being publishers, excluded gays from the newsroom\nfor decades, ran a succession process featuring only three cis straight white male\ncousins, and ended up with a publisher who just happened to be the son of the\nprevious guy.\nSuppose you\u2019re a founder.

Many billions of dollars are spent\non history in the engineering world. We don\u2019t think about it that way, though.\nWe call it doing a post-mortem, looking over the log \ufb01les, maybe running a so-\ncalled time-travel debugger to get a reproducible bug. Once we \ufb01nd it, we might\nwant to execute an undo, do a git revert , restore from backup, or return to a\npreviously known-good con\ufb01guration.\nThink about what we\u2019re saying: on a micro-scale, knowing the detailed past of the\nsystem allows us to \ufb01gure out what had gone wrong.

All these concepts apply to debugging situations at larger scale\nthan companies \u2014 like societies, or countries.\nYou now see why history is useful. A founder of a mere startup company can arguably\nscrape by without it, tacitly outsourcing the study of history to those who shape\nsociety\u2019s laws and morality.

We start with bottom-up history. The section on Microhistory and Macrohistory\nbridges the gap between the trajectory of an isolated, reproducible system and\nthe trajectories of millions of interacting human beings. Because both these small\nand large-scale trajectories can now be digitally recorded and quanti\ufb01ed, this is\nhistory as written to the ledger \u2014 culminating in the cryptohistory of Bitcoin.\n2. We next discuss top-down history. This is history as written by the winners,\nhistory as conceptualized by what Tyler Cowen calls the Base-Raters, history\nthat justi\ufb01es the current order and proclaims it stable and inevitable. It is a\ntheory of Political Power vs. Technological Truth .\n3. We then talk about the history of power, giving names to the forces we just de-\nscribed by identifying the three candidates for most powerful force in the world:\nGod, State, and Network . Framing things in terms of threeprime movers rather\nthan one allows us to generalize beyond purely God-centered religions to under-\nstand the Leviathan-centered doctrines that implicitly underpin modern society.\n4. We apply this to the history of power struggles. With the God/State/Network\nlens, we can understand the Blue/Red and Tech-vs-Media con\ufb02icts in a di\ufb00erent\nway as a multi-sided struggle between People of God, People of the State, and\nPeople of the Network .\n5. We go through how the People of the State have used their power to distort recent26 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nand distant history, and how the Network is newly rectifying this distortion in\n\u201cIf the News is Fake, Imagine History.\u201d\n6. Having shown the degree to which history has been distorted, and thereby dis-\nplaced the (implicit) historical narrative in which the arc of history bends to the\nineluctable victory of the US establishment, we discuss several alternative theo-\nries of past and future in our section on Fragmentation, Frontier, Fourth Turning,\nand Future Is Our Past . These theses don\u2019t describe a clean progressive victory\noneveryaxis, butinsteadasetofcycles, hairpinturns, andmirrorimages, asetof\nhistorical trajectories far more complex than the narrative of linear inevitability\nsmuggled in through textbooks and mass media.\n7. We next turn our attention to left and right, which are confusing concepts in\na realigning time, in Left is the new Right is the new Left . Sorry! We can\u2019t\navoid politics anymore. Startup societies aren\u2019t purely about technology. But\nplease note that for the most part this section isn\u2019tthe same old pabulum around\ncurrent events. We do contend that you need a theory of left and right to build\na startup society, but that doesn\u2019t mean just picking a side.\nWhy? While a political consumer has to pick one of a few party platforms o\ufb00\nthe menu, a political founder can do something di\ufb00erent: ideology construction.\nTo inform this, we\u2019ll show how left and right have swapped sides through history,\nand how any successful mass movement has botha revolutionary left component\nand a ruling right component.\n8. Finally, all of this builds up to the payo\ufb00: the One Commandment . Using the\nterminology we just introduced, we can rattle it o\ufb00 in a few paragraphs. (If the\nfollowing is opaque in any way, read the chapter, then come back and re-read this\npart.)\nIf history is not pre-determined to bend in one direction, if the current establish-\nment may experience dramatic disruption in the form of the Fragmentation and\nFourth Turning , if its power actually arose from the expanding frontier rather\nthan the expanding franchise, if history is somehow running in reverse as per\ntheFuture Is Our Past thesis, if the revolutionary and ruling classes are in fact\nswitching sides, if the new Leviathan that is the Network is indeed rising above\nthe State, and if the internal American con\ufb02icts can be seen not as policy dis-\nputes but as holy wars, as clashes of Leviathans...then the assumption of the\nBase-Raters that all will proceed as it always has is quite incorrect! But rather\nthan admit this incorrectness, they\u2019ll attempt to use political power to suppress\ntechnological truth.2.1. PROLOGUE 27\nThe founder\u2019s counter is cryptohistory and the startup society. We now have\na history no establishment can easily corrupt, the cryptographically veri\ufb01able\nhistory pioneered by Bitcoin and extended via crypto oracles. We also have a\ntheory of historical feasibility , history as a trajectory rather than an inevitability,\nthe idea that the desirable future will only occur if you put in individual e\ufb00ort.\nBut what exactly is the nature of that desirable future?\nAfter all, many groups di\ufb00er with the old order but also with each other \u2014 so a\nblanket solution won\u2019t work. And could well be resisted. That\u2019s where the One\nCommandment comes in.\nAs context, the modern person is often morally reticent but politically evange-\nlistic. They hesitate to talk about what is moral or immoral, because it\u2019s not\ntheir place to say what\u2019s right. Yet when it comes to politics, this di\ufb03dence is\nfrequently replaced by overbearing con\ufb01dence in how others must live, coupled\nwith an enthusiasm for enforcing their beliefs at gunpoint if necessary.\nIn between this zero and 1, in between eschewing moral discussion entirely and\nimposing a full-blown political doctrine, in this \ufb01nal section we propose a one: a\none commandment. Start a new society with its own moral code, based on your\nstudy of history, and recruit people that agree with you to populate it.We\u2019re\nnot saying you need to come up with your own new Ten Commandments, mind\nyou \u2014 but you do need One Commandment to establish the di\ufb00erentiation of a\nnew startup society.\nConcrete examples of possible One Commandments include \u201c24/7 internet bad\u201d\n(which leads to a Digital Sabbath society), or \u201ccarbs bad\u201d (which leads to a Keto\nKosher society), or \u201ctraditional Christianity good\u201d (which leads to a Benedict\nOption society), or \u201clife extension good\u201d (which leads to a post-FDA society).\nYou might think these One Commandments sound either trivial or unrealistically\nambitious, but in that respect they\u2019re similar to tech; the pitch of \u201c140 charac-\nters\u201d sounded trivial and the pitch of \u201creusable rockets\u201d seemed unrealistic, but\nthose resulted in Twitter and SpaceX respectively. The One Commandment is\nalso similar to tech in another respect: it focusesa startup society on a single\nmoral innovation, just like a tech company is about a focusedtechnoeconomic\ninnovation.\nThat is, as we\u2019ll see, each One Commandment-based startup society is premised\non deconstructing the establishment\u2019s history in one speci\ufb01c area, erecting a re-\nplacement narrative in its place with a new One Commandment, then provingthe\nsocioeconomic value of that One Commandment by using it to attract subscriber-\ncitizens. For example, if you can attract 100k subscribers to your Keto Kosher\nsociety through deeply researched historical studies on the obesity epidemic, and\nthen show that they\u2019ve lost signi\ufb01cant weight as a consequence, you\u2019ve proven28 CHAPTER 2.

That\u2019ll either drive them to reform\n\u2014 ornotreform, in which case you attract more citizens.\nAkeypointisthatwecanapplyallthetechniquesofstartupcompaniestostartup\nsocieties. Financing, attracting subscribers, calculating churn, doing customer\nsupport \u2014 there\u2019s a playbook for all of that. It\u2019s just Society-as-a-Service, the\nnew SaaS.\nIn parallel, other startup societies are likewise critiquing by building, draining\ncitizens away from the establishment with their own historically-informed One\nCommandments, and thereby driving change on other dimensions. Finally, dif-\nferent successful changes can be copied and merged together, such that the sec-\nond generation of startup societies starts di\ufb00erentiating from the establishment\nby two, three, or Ncommandments. This is a vision for peaceful, parallelized,\nhistorically-driven reform of a broken society.\nOk!

It has neither the motive nor the means to deceive you about its \ufb02ight\npath. Humans do. The people under the microscope are fogging the lens.\nSo: the scale is huge, the timeframe is long, and the measurements aren\u2019t just noisy\nbut intentionally corrupted.30 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nWe can encode all of this into a phrase: history is a cryptic epic of twisting trajectories .\nCryptic, because the narrators are unreliable and often intentionally misleading. Epic,\nbecause the timescales are so long that you have to consciously sample beyond your\nown experience and beyond any human lifetime to see patterns. Twisting, because\nthere are curves, cycles, collapses, and non-straightforward patterns. And trajectories,\nbecause history is ultimately about the time evolution of human beings, which maps to\nthe physical idea of a dynamical system, of a set of particles progressing through time.\nPut that together, and it wipes out both the base-rater\u2019s view that today\u2019s order will\nremain basically stable over the short-term, and the complementary view of a long-term\n\u201cthe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u201d It also contests\nthe idea that the fall of the bourgeoisie \u201cand the victory of the proletariat are equally\ninevitable,\u201d or that \u201cno two countries on a Bitcoin standard will go to war with each\nother,\u201d or even that technological progress has been rapid, so we can assume it will\ncontinue and society will not collapse.\nThose phrases come from di\ufb00erent ideologies, but each of them verbally expresses the\nclean parabolic arc of the rock. History isn\u2019t really like that at all. It\u2019s much more\ncomplicated. There are certainly trends, and those phrases do identify real trends, but\nthere is also pushback to those trends, counterforces that arise in response to applied\nforces, syntheses that form from theses and antitheses, and outright collapses. Complex\ndynamics, in other words.\nAnd how do we study complex dynamical systems? The \ufb01rst task is to measure.", "num_tokens": 911}, "18": {"document": "2.2.2 Microhistory is the History of Reproducible Systems\nMicrohistory is the history of a reproducible system, one which has few enough vari-\nables that it can be reset and replayed from the beginning in a series of controlled\nexperiments. It is history as a quantitative trajectory, history as a precise log of mea-\nsurements. For example, it could be the record of all past values of a state space vector\nin a dynamical system, the account of all moves made by two deterministic algorithms\nplaying chess against each other, or the chronicle of all instructions executed by a\njournaling \ufb01le system after being restored to factory settings.\nMicrohistory is an applied subject, where accurate historical measurement is of di-\nrect technical and commercial importance. We can see this with technologies like the\nKalman \ufb01lter, which was used for steering the spaceship used in the moon landing.\nYou can see the full technical details here, but roughly speaking the Kalman \ufb01lter uses\npast measurements x[t\u00001];x[t\u00002];x[t\u00003]to inform the estimate of a system\u2019s current\nstatex[t], the action that should be taken u[t], and the corresponding prediction of the\nfuture state x[t+ 1]should that action be taken. For example, it uses past velocity,\ndirection headings, fuel levels, and the like to recommend how a space shuttle should be\nsteered at the current timestep. Crucially, if the microhistory is not accurate enough, if\nthe con\ufb01dence intervals around each measurement are too wide, or if (say) the velocity\nestimate is wrong altogether, then the Kalman Filter does not work and Apollo doesn\u2019t2.2. MICROHISTORY AND MACROHISTORY 31\nhappen.\nAt a surface level, the Kalman \ufb01lter resembles the kind of time series analysis that\u2019s\ncommon in \ufb01nance. The key di\ufb00erence is that the Kalman \ufb01lter is used on reproducible\nsystemswhile\ufb01nanceistypicallya non-reproducible system. Ifyou\u2019reusingtheKalman\n\ufb01lter to guide a drone from point A to point B, but you have a bug in your code and\nthe drone crashes, you can simply pick up the drone, put it back on the launch pad\nat point A, and try again. Because you can repeat the experiment over and over, you\ncan eventually get very precise measurements and a functioning guidance algorithm.\nThat\u2019s a reproducible system.\nIn \ufb01nance, however, you usually can\u2019t just keep re-running a trading algorithm that\nmakes money and get the same result. Eventually your counterparties will adapt and\nget wise. A key di\ufb00erence relative to our drone example is the presence of animate\nobjects (other humans) who won\u2019t always do the same thing given the same input.\nIn fact, they can often be adversarial, observing and reacting to your actions, inten-\ntionally confounding your predictions, especially if they can pro\ufb01t from doing so. Past\nperformance is no guarantee of future results in \ufb01nance, as opposed to physics. Unlike\nthe situation with the drone, a market isn\u2019t a reproducible system.\nMicrohistory thus has its limits, but it\u2019s an incredibly powerful concept. If we have\ngood enough measurements on the past, then we have a better prediction of the future\nin an extremely literal sense. If we have tight con\ufb01dence intervals on our measurements\nof the past, if the probability distribution P(x[t\u00001])is highly peaked, then we get\ncorrespondingly tight con\ufb01dence intervals on the present P(x[t])and the future P(x[t+\n1]).

Only a civilization with a\nstrong capacity for accurate microhistory could ever make it to the moon.\nThis is a powerful analogy for civilization.

At small scale, that\u2019s the unpredictable\n\ufb02ow of a turbulent \ufb02uid; at very large scale, it\u2019s the history of humanity.\nWe think of macrohistory as being on a continuum with microhistory. Why? We\u2019ll\nmake a few points and then tie them all together.\n\u2022First, science progresses by taking phenomena formerly thought of as non-\nreproducible (and hence unpredictable) systems, isolating the key variables, and\nturning them into reproducible (and hence predictable) systems. For example,\nKoch\u2019s postulates include the idea of transmission pathogenesis, which turned\nthe vague concept of infection via \u201cmiasma\u201d into a reproducible phenomenon: ex-\npose a mouse to a speci\ufb01c microorganism in a laboratory setting and an infection\narises, but not otherwise.\n\u2022Second, and relatedly, science progresses by improved instrumentation, by better\nrecordkeeping. Star charts enabled celestial navigation. Johann Balmer\u2019s doc-\numentation of the exact spacing of hydrogen\u2019s emission spectra led to quantum\nmechanics. Gregor Mendel\u2019s careful counting of pea plants led to modern genet-\nics. Things we counted as simply beyond human ken \u2014 the stars, the atom, the\ngenome \u2014 became things humans can comprehend by simply counting.\n\u2022Third, how do we even know anything about the history of ancient Rome or\nEgypt or Medieval Europe? From artifacts and written records. Thousands of\nyears ago, people were scratching customer reviews into a stone tablet, one of the\n\ufb01rst tablet-based apps. We know who Abelard and Heloise were from their letters\nto each other. We know what the Romans were like from what they recorded. To\na signi\ufb01cant extent, what we know about history is what we\u2019ve recovered from\nwhat people wrote down.\n\u2022Fourth, today, we have digital documentation on an unprecedented scale. We\nhave billions of people using social media each day for almost a decade now.\nWe also have billions of phones taking daily photographs and videos. We have\ncountless data feeds of instruments. And we have massive hard drives to store it\nall. So, if reckoned on the basis of raw bytes, we likely record more information\nin a day than all of humanity recorded up to the year 1900. It is by far the most\ncomprehensive log of human activity we\u2019ve ever had.\nWe can now see the continuumbetween macrohistory and microhistory. We are col-\nlecting the kinds of precise, quantitative, microhistorical measurements that typically\nled to the emergence of a new science...but at the scale of billions of people, and going\ninto our second decade.2.2. MICROHISTORY AND MACROHISTORY 33\nSo, another term for \u201cBig Data\u201d should be \u201cBig History.\u201d All data is a record of\npast events, sometimes the immediate past, sometimes the past of months or years\nago, sometimes (in the case of Google Books or the Digital Michelangelo project) the\npast of decades or centuries ago. After all, what\u2019s another word for data storage in a\ncomputer? Memory. Memory, as in the sense of human memory, and as in the sense\nof history.\nThat memory is commercially valuable. A technologist who neglects history ensures\ntheir users will get exploited. Proof? Consider reputation systems. Any scaled market-\nplace has them. The historyof an Uber driver or rider\u2019s on-platform behavior partially\npredicts their future behavior. Without years of star ratings, without memories of past\nactions of millions of people, these platforms would be wrecked by fraud. Macrohistory\nmakes money.\nThis is just one example. There are huge short and long-term incentives to record all\nthis data, all this microhistory and macrohistory. And future historianswill study\nour digital log to understand what we were like as a civilization.", "num_tokens": 948}, "20": {"document": "2.2.4 Bitcoin\u2019s Blockchain Is a Technology for Robust Macro-\n\nThere are some catches to the concept of digital macrohistory, though: silos, bots,\ncensors, and fakes. As we\u2019ll show, Bitcoin and its generalizations provide a powerful\nway to solve these issues.\nFirst, let\u2019s understand the problems of silos, bots, censors, and fakes. The macrohis-\ntorical log is largely siloed across di\ufb00erent corporate servers, on the premises of Twitter\nand Facebook and Google. The posts are typically not digitally signed or cryptograph-\nically timestamped, so much of the content is (or could be) from bots rather than\nhumans. Inconvenient digital history can be deleted by putting su\ufb03cient pressure on\ncentralized social media companies or academic publishers, censoring true information\nin the name of taking down \u201cdisinformation,\u201d as we\u2019ve already seen. And the advent\nof AI allows highly realistic fakes of the past and present to be generated. If we\u2019re not\ncareful, we could drown in fake data.\nSo, how could someone in the future (or even the present) know if a particular event\nthey didn\u2019t directly observe was real? The Bitcoin blockchain gives one answer. It is\nthe most rigorous form of history yet known to man, a history that is technically and\neconomicallyresistanttorevision. Thankstoacombinationofcryptographicprimitives\nand \ufb01nancial incentives, it is very challenging to falsify the who, what, and when of\ntransactions written to the Bitcoin blockchain.\nWho initiated this transfer, what amount of Bitcoin did they send, what metadata\ndid they attach to the transaction, and when did they send it? That information is\nrecorded in the blockchain and su\ufb03cient to give a bare bones history of the entire34 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nBitcoin economy since 2009. And if you sum up that entire history to the present day,\nyou also get the values of how much BTC is held by each address. It\u2019s an immediatist\nmodel of history, where the past is not even past - it\u2019s with us at every second.\nIn a little more detail, whyis the Bitcoin blockchain so resistant to the rewriting\nof history? To falsify the \u201cwho\u201d of a single transaction you\u2019d need to fake a digital\nsignature, to falsify the \u201cwhat\u201d you\u2019d need to break a hash function, to falsify the\n\u201cwhen\u201d you\u2019dneedtocorruptatimestamp, andyou\u2019dneedtodothiswhilesomehownot\nbreaking all the other records cryptographically connected to that transaction through\nthe mechanism of composed block headers.\nSome call the Bitcoin blockchain a timechain , because unlike many other blockchains,\nits proof-of-work mechanism and di\ufb03culty adjustment ensure a statistically regular\ntime interval between blocks, crucial to its function as a digital history.\n(I recognize that these concepts and some of what follows is technical. Our whirlwind\ntourmayprovokeeitherfamiliarhead-noddingorconfusedhead-scratching. Ifyouwant\nmore detail, we\u2019ve linked de\ufb01nitions of each term, but fully explaining them is beyond\nthe scope of this work. However, see The Truth Machine for a popular treatment and\nDan Boneh\u2019s Cryptography course for technical detail.)\nNevertheless, here\u2019s the point for even a nontechnical reader: the Bitcoin blockchain\ngives ahistory that\u2019s hard to falsify . Unless there\u2019s an advance in quantum computing,\nabreakthroughinpuremath, aheretoforeunseenbuginthecode, orahighlyexpensive\n51% attack that probably only China could muster, it is essentially infeasible to rewrite\nthe history of the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 or anything written to it. And even if such\nan event doeshappen, it wouldn\u2019t be an instantaneous burning of Bitcoin\u2019s Library\nof Alexandria. The hash function could be replaced with a quantum-safe version, or\nanother chain robust to said attack could take Bitcoin\u2019s place, and back up the ledger\nof all historical Bitcoin transactions to a new protocol.\nWith that said, we are not arguing that Bitcoin is infallible. We are arguing that it\nis the best technology yet invented for recording human history. And if the concept\nof cryptocurrency can endure past the invention of quantum decryption, we will likely\nthink of the beginning of cryptographically veri\ufb01able history as on par with the begin-\nning of written history millennia ago. Future societies may think of the year 2022 AD\nas the year 13 AS, with \u201cAfter Satoshi\u201d as the new \u201cAnno Domini,\u201d and the block clock\nas the new universal time.", "num_tokens": 1075}, "21": {"document": "2.2.5 The Bitcoin Blockchain Can Record Non-Bitcoin Events\nFor the price of a single transaction, the Bitcoin blockchain can be generalized to\nprovideacryptographicallyveri\ufb01ablerecordofanyhistoricalevent, a proof-of-existence .\nFor example, perhaps there is some o\ufb00-chain event of signi\ufb01cant importance where you\nwant to store it for the record.

That future observer might well suspect the photo could still be fake, but\nthey\u2019d know it\u2019d have to be faked at that precise time by the party controlling that\nwallet. And the evidence would be on-chain years before the airbrushed o\ufb03cial photo\nof Stalin was released. That\u2019s implausible under many models. Who\u2019d fake something\nso speci\ufb01c years in advance? It\u2019d be more likely the o\ufb03cial photo was fake than the\nproof-of-existence.\nSo, let\u2019s suppose that this limited level of proof was worth it to you. You are willing\nto pay such that future generations can see an indelible record of a bit of history. How\nwould you get that proof onto the Bitcoin blockchain?\nThe way you\u2019d do this is by organizing your arbitrarily large external dataset (a photo,\nor something much larger than that) into a Merkle tree, calculating a string of \ufb01xed\nlength called a Merkle root, and then writing that to the Bitcoin blockchain through\nOP_RETURN . This furnishes a tool for proof-of-existence for any digital \ufb01le.\nYou can do this as a one-o\ufb00 for a single piece of data, or as a periodic backup for any\nnon-Bitcoin chain. So you could, in theory, put a digital summary of many gigabytes\nof data from another chain on the Bitcoin blockchain every ten minutes for the price\nof a single BTC transaction, thereby proving it existed. This would e\ufb00ectively \u201cback\nup\u201d this other blockchain and give it some of the irreversibility properties of Bitcoin.\nCall this kind of chain a subchain.\nBy analogy to the industrial use of gold, this type of \u201cindustrial\u201d use case of a Bitcoin\ntransaction may turn out to be quite important. A subchain with many millions of o\ufb00-\nBitcoin transactions every ten minutes could likely generate enough economic activity\nto easily pay for a single Bitcoin transaction.36 CHAPTER 2.

Nothing\nis lost.\nExcept, of course, for all the o\ufb00-chain data that accompanies a transaction - like the\nidentity of the sender and receiver, the reason for their transaction, the SKU of any\ngoods sold, and so on. There are usually good reasons for these things to remain\nprivate, or partially private, so you might think this is a feature.\nThe problem is that Bitcoin\u2019s design is a bit of a tweener, as it doesn\u2019t actually ensure\nthat public transactions remain private. Indeed there are companies like Elliptic and\nChainalysis devoted entirely to the deanonymization of public Bitcoin addresses and\ntransactions. The right model of the history of the Bitcoin economy is that it\u2019s in\na hybrid state, where the public has access to the raw transaction data, but private\nactors (like Chainalysis and Elliptic) have access to much more information and can\ndeanonymize many transactions.\nMoreover, Bitcoin can onlyexecute Bitcoin transactions, rather than all the other kinds\nof digital operations you could facilitate with more blockspace.

What techniques are they using? It\u2019s not just a\nrandom collection of names and dates. They have proven techniques for sifting through\nthe archives, for sta\ufb03ng a retinue of heros and villains from the past, for distilling the\ndocuments into (politically) useful parables. Here are two of them.\n\u2022Political determinist model: history is written by the winners. People have heard\nthis saying, but taking it seriously has profound implications. For example, who-\never claims to be writing the \u201c\ufb01rst draft of history\u201d is therefore one of the win-\nners. For another, history is what\u2019s useful to the regime. A classic example is\nKatyn Forest: the admission that the Soviets did it would have delegitimized\ntheir postwar control over Poland during the 1945-1991 period, but once the\nUSSR collapsed the truth could be revealed.\n\u2022Political mascot model: history is written by winners pretending to be acting\non behalf of losers. This is a variant of the political determinist model, also\nknown as \u201co\ufb00ense archaeology,\u201d and practiced by the modern American, Chinese,\nand Russian establishments \u2014 all of whom portray themselves as victims.

AgaintakingtheUSSRasacasestudy, thisinvolved\ufb01ndingendless(real!)\nexamples of Western capitalists screwing the working class, and suppressing the\nworse (also real!) instances of Soviet communists gulaging theirworking class, as\nwell as cases of the working class itself behaving badly. Generalization to other\ncontexts is left as an exercise for the reader, but here\u2019s a Russian example of what\nan American would call \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d (R2P).\nThese techniques are used to write history that favors a state. Here are more examples:\n\u2022CCP China : Today\u2019s Chinese media covers the Eight-Nations Alliance, the\nOpium Wars, and the like exhaustively in its domestic output, as these events\nshow the malevolence of the European colonialists \u2014 who literally fought wars to\nkeep China subjugated and addicted to heroin. Their domestic history does not\nmention the Uighurs, Tiananmen, and the like domestically. Xi\u2019s CCP did stress\nthe domestic problem of corruption via the \u201cTigers and Flies\u201d campaign...but\nthat\u2019s in part because the anti-corruption campaign was politically useful against\nhis internal enemies, and seemed not to ensnare his allies.\n\u2022US Establishment : Today\u2019s US establishment covers 6/4/1989 and the 2022\nRusso-Ukrainian War heavily, because they are real events that make China and\nRussia look bad and the US look good. It does not mention the 1900 Eight-\nNations Alliance (when the US helped invade China with a \u201ccoalition of the will-40 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\ning\u201d to defend European imperialism) or the 1932 Ukrainian Holodomor (when\nThe New York Times Company\u2019s Walter Duranty helped Soviet Russia choke out\nUkraine) as these cut in the opposite direction.\nThe current US narrative also does not stress the Cultural Revolution (which\nbears too close a resemblance to present day America), or Western journalists\nlike Edgar Snow who helped Mao come to power, or the full ugly history of\nAmerican support for Russian and Chinese communism. This isn\u2019t simply a\nmatter of the age of events \u2014 after all, regime media goes back further in time\nwhen convenient, distorting events from 1619 for today\u2019s headlines, yet somehow\ntheir time machine stutters on the years 1932 or 1900. In modern America, as in\nmodern China, the history you hear about is the history the establishment \ufb01nds\nto be politically useful against its internal and external rivals.\n\u2022The British Empire : The British in both WW1 and WW2 understandably em-\nphasized the evils of Germany, but not so much the evils of their ally Russia, or\ntheir own evils during the Opium Wars, or the desire for the Indian subcontinent\nto breathe free, and so on. (This one is almost too easy as the UK is no longer\na contender for heavyweight champion of the world, so no one is o\ufb00ended when\nsomeone points out its past self-serving inconsistencies. Indeed, documenting the\nUK\u2019s sins is now a cottage industry for Britain\u2019s virtue signalers, as beating up\non a beaten empire is far easier than tackling the taboos of a still live one.)\nPoint being: once you get your head out of the civilization you grew up in, and look at\nthings comparatively, the techniques of political history become obvious. One of those\ntechniques deserves special mention, and that\u2019s a peacetime version of the \u201catrocity\nstory\u201d:\nOne of the most time-honored techniques to mobilize public animosity\nagainst the enemy and to justify military action is the atrocity story. This\ntechnique, says Professor Lasswell, has been used \u201cwith unvarying success\nin every con\ufb02ict known to man.\u201d\nThe concept is as useful in peacetime as it is in war. Why? Because states get their\npeople hyped up to \ufb01ght wars by stressing the essentially defensive nature of what they\nare doing and the savage behavior of the enemy. But war is politics by other means, so\npolitics is war by other means. Even in peacetime, the state is predicated on force. And\nthis use of force requires justi\ufb01cation. The atrocity story is the tool used to convince\npeople that the use of state force is legitimate.\nComing from a di\ufb00erent vantage point, Rene Girard would call this a \u201cfounding mur-\nder.\u201d Once you see this technique, you see it everywhere. Somewhat toned-down\nversions of the atrocity story are the go-to technique used to justify expansions of\npolitical power.\n\u2022If we don\u2019t force people to take o\ufb00 their shoes at the airport, people will die!\n\u2022If we don\u2019t stop people from voluntarily taking experimental curative drugs, peo-2.3. POLITICAL POWER AND TECHNOLOGICAL TRUTH 41\nple will die!\n\u2022If we don\u2019t set up a disinformation o\ufb03ce to stop people from making hostile\ncomments online, people will die!\nIndeed, almost everything in politics is backed by an atrocity story.There\u2019s a some-\ntimes real, sometimes fake, sometimes exaggerated Girardian founding murder (or at\nleast founding injury) behind much of what the government does.\nSometimes the atrocity story is framed in terms of terrorists, sometimes in terms of\nchildren...but the general concept is \u201csomething so bad happened, we must use (state)\nforce to prevent it from happening again.\u201d Often this completely ignores the death\ncaused by that force itself. For example, when the FDA \u201cprevented\u201d deaths by cracking\ndown on drug approvals after thalidomide, it caused many more deaths via Eroom\u2019s\nLaw and drug lag.\nAndsometimestheatrocitystoryisjustcompletelyfake; beforeIraqwasfalselyaccused\nof holding WMD, it was falsely accused of tossing babies from incubators.\nWith that said, it\u2019s possible to overcorrect here. Just because there is an incentive to\nfake (or exaggerate) atrocities does not mean that allatrocities are fake or exagger-\nated.Yes, you should be aware that states are always \u201c\ufb02opping,\u201d exaggerating the\nseverity of the fouls against them or the mascots they claim to represent, trying to\nbring in the public on their side, whether they are Chinese or American or Russian.\nBut once you\u2019re aware of the political power model of history, the next goal is to guard\nagainst both the Scylla and the Charybdis, against being too credulous andtoo cynical.\nBecause just as the atrocity story is a tool for political power, unfortunately so too is\ngenocide denial \u2014 as we can see from The New York Times\u2019 Pulitzer-winning coverup\nof Stalin\u2019s Ukrainian famine.\nTo maintain this balance, to know when states are lying or not, we need a form of truth\npowerful enough to stand outside any state and judge it from above. A way to respond\nto o\ufb03cial statistics not with either re\ufb02exive faith or disbelief, but with dispassionate,\nindependent calculation.", "num_tokens": 1993}, "26": {"document": "The bottom-up cryptohistory we introduced in the previous section is clearly relevant.\nBut to fully appreciate it we need an allied theory: the technological truth theory of\nhistory.42 CHAPTER 2.

After all, a\nsociety must pass down true facts about nature, for example, or else its crops will not\ngrow\u2014 and its political class will losepower.\nThis leads to a di\ufb00erent set of tech-focused lenses for analyzing history.\n\u2022Technological determinist model: technology is the driving force of history . While\nthe political determinist model stresses that history is written \u2014 and hence dis-\ntorted \u2014 by the winners, and thereby propagates only that which is useful to a\ngiven state, the technological determinist model notes that there are some key\nareas \u2014 principally in science and technology \u2014 where many (if not most) soci-\neties derive a bene\ufb01t from passing down a technical fact withoutdistortion. There\nis after all an unbroken chain from Archimedes, Aryabhata, Al-Kwarizhmi, and\nantiquity to all our existing science and technology. Hundreds of years later, we\ndon\u2019t care that much about the laws of Isaac Newton\u2019s time, but we do care about\nNewton\u2019s laws. In this model, all political ideologies have been around for all time\n\u2014 the only thing that changes is whether a given ideology is now technologically\nfeasible as an organizing system for humanity. Thus: political fashions just come\nand go in cycles, so the absolute measure of societal progress is a culture\u2019s level\nof technological advancement on something like the Kardashev scale.\n\u2022Trajectory model: histories are trajectories. We mentioned this concept before\nwhen we discussed history as a cryptic epic of twisting trajectories, but it\u2019s worth\nreprising. If you\u2019re technically inclined, you might wonder why we spend so\nmuch time on history in this book. One answer is that histories are trajectories\nof dynamical systems. If you can spend your entire life studying wave equations,\ndi\ufb00usion equations, time series, or the Navier-Stokes equations \u2014 and you can \u2014\nyou can do the same for the dynamics of people. In more detail, we know from\nphysics (and Stephen Wolfram!) that very simple rules can produce incredibly\ncomplicated trajectories of dynamical systems. For Navier-Stokes, for example,\nwe can divide these trajectories up into laminar \ufb02ow, turbulent \ufb02ow, inviscid2.3. POLITICAL POWER AND TECHNOLOGICAL TRUTH 43\n\ufb02ow, incompressible \ufb02ow, and so on, to describe di\ufb00erent ways a velocity \ufb01eld\ncan evolve over time. These classi\ufb01cations are derived from measurements made\nof \ufb02uids over time. And the study of just one of these trajectory types can be a\nwhole research discipline.\nThat\u2019s how rich the dynamics of inanimate objects are. Now compare that to\nthe macroscopic movements of millions of intelligent agents. You can similarly\ntry to derive rules about how humans behave under situations of laminar good\ntimes, turbulent revolutionary times, and so on by studying the records we have\nof human behavior \u2014 the data exhaust that humans produce.\nThis analogy is actually very tight if you think about virtual economies and the\nhistory of human behavior on social networks and cryptosystems. In the fullness\nof time, with truly open datasets, we may even be able to develop Asimovian\npsychohistory from all the data recorded in the ledger of record, namely a way to\npredict the macroscopic behavior of humans in certain situations without know-\ning every microscopic detail. We can already somewhat do this for constructed\nenvironments like gamesand markets, and ever more human environments are\nbecoming literally digitally constructed.\n\u2022Statistical model: history aids predictions . From a statistician\u2019s perspective, his-\ntory is necessary for accurately computing the future. See any time series analysis\nor machine learning paper \u2014 or the Kalman \ufb01lter, which makes this concept very\nexplicit. To paraphrase Orwell, without a quantitatively accurate record of the\npast you cannot control the future, in the sense that your control theory literally\nwon\u2019t work.\n\u2022Helix model: linear and cyclical history can coexist . From a progressive\u2019s perspec-\ntive, history is a linear trend, where the \u201carc of history\u201d bends towards freedom,\nand where those against a given cause are on the wrong side of history. Others\nthink of history as cyclical, a constant loop where the only thing these technolo-\ngists are doing is reinventing the wheel, or where \u201cstrong men create good times,\ngood times create weak men, weak men create hard times, and hard times cre-\nate strong men.\u201d But there\u2019s a third view, a helical view of history, which says\nthat from one viewpoint history is indeed progressive, from another it\u2019s genuinely\ncyclical, and the reconciliation is that we move a bit forward technologically with\neach turn of the corkscrew rather than collapsing. In this view, attempts to re-\nstore the immediate preceding state are unlikely, as they\u2019re rewinding the clock\n\u2014 but you might be able to get to a good state by winding the helix all the way44 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\npast 12\u2019o\u2019clock to get the reboot. Or you might just collapse.\n\u2022Ozymandias model: civilization can collapse. History shows us that technological\nprogress is not inevitable. The Fall of Civilizations podcast really makes this\nclear. Gobekli Tepe is one example. Whether you\u2019re thinking of this as an\nastronomer (where are all the intelligent life forms out there? Is the universe a\ndark forest?) or an anthropologist (how did all these advanced civilizations just\ncompletely die out?), it\u2019s sobering to think that our civilization may just be like\nthe best player in a video game so far: we\u2019ve made it the furthest, but we have\nno guarantee that we\u2019re going to win before killing ourselvesand wiping out\nlike all the other civilizations before us.\n\u2022Lenski model: organisms are not ordinal. Richard Lenski ran a famous series of\nlong-term evolution experiments with E. coli where he picked out a fresh culture\nof bacteria each day, froze it down in suspended animation, and thereby saved\na snapshot of what each day of evolution looked like over the course of decades.\nThe amazing thing about bacteria is that they can be unfrozen and reanimated,\nso Lenski could take an old E. coli strain from day 1173 and put it into a test\ntube with today\u2019s strain to see who\u2019d reproduce the most in a head-to-head\ncompetition. The result showed that history is not strictly ordinal ; just because\nthe day 1174 strain had outcompeted the day 1173 strain, and the day 1175 strain\nhad outcompeted the day 1174 strain, and so on \u2014 does notnecessarily mean\nthat today\u2019s strain will always win a head to head with the strain from day 1173.\nThe complexity of biology is such that it\u2019s more like an unpredictable game of\nrock/paper/scissors.\n\u2022Train Crash model: those who don\u2019t know history are doomed to repeat it. Another\nway to think about history is as a set of expensive experiments, where people\noften made certain choices that seemed reasonable at the time and ended up in\ncalamitous straits. That\u2019s communism, for example: a persuasive idea for many,\nbut one that history shows to not actually produce great results in practice.\n\u2022Idea Maze model: those who over\ufb01t to history will never invent the future. This\nis the counterargument to the Train Crash model \u2014 past results may not predict\nfuture performance, and sometimes you need to have a beginner\u2019s mindset to\ninnovate. Generally this works better for opt-in technologies and investments\nthan top-down modi\ufb01cations of society like communism. One tool for this comes\nfromaconceptIwroteupawhileagocalledtheideamaze. Therelevantbithereis\nthatjustbecauseabusinesspropositiondidn\u2019tworkinthepastdoesn\u2019tnecessarily\nmean it won\u2019t work today. The technological and social prerequisites may have\ndramatically changed, and doors previously closed may now have opened. Unlike\nthe laws of physics, society is not time invariant. As even the world\u2019s leading\nanti-tech blog once admitted:2.3.

Instead, theyseemhardly toadvance atall, moving forward\nin \ufb01ts and starts, through shame spirals and bankruptcies and hype\nand defensive crouches \u2014 until one day, in a sudden about-face, they\nutterly, totally win.\n\u2022Wright-Fisher model: history is what survives natural selection. In population\ngenetics, there\u2019s an important model of how mutations arise and spread called\nthe Wright-Fisher model. When a new mutation arises, it\u2019s in only 1 out of N\npeople. How does it get to N out of N, to 100%, to what\u2019s called \u201c\ufb01xation\u201d? Well,\n\ufb01rst, it might not ever do that. It might just die out. It might also get to N out of\nN simply by luck, if the population of N is small \u2014 this is known as \u201c\ufb01xation by\ngenetic drift,\u201d where those with the mutation just happen to reproduce more than\nothers. But if the mutation confers some selective advantage s, if it aids in the\nreproduction of its host in a competitive environment, then it has a better than\nluck chance of getting to 100%. Similarly, those historical ideas that we\u2019ve heard\nabout can be thought of as those that aided or at least did not interfere with\nthe propagation of their respective carriers, often the authorities that write those\nhistories. Some of these ideas have tagged along by dumb luck, while others are\nclaims that were selectively advantageous to the success of the regime - often by\ndelegitimizing their rivals and legitimizing their own rule, or by giving them new\ntechnologies. This is a theory of memetic evolution; the ideological mutations\nthat add technological edge or political power are the ones selected for.\n\u2022Computational model: history is the on-chain population; all the rest is editorial-\nization. There\u2019s a great book by Franco Moretti called Graphs, Maps, and Trees .\nIt\u2019s a computational study of literature. Moretti\u2019s argument is that every other\nstudy of literature is inherently biased. The selection of which books to discuss\nis itself an implicit editorialization. He instead makes this completely explicit by\ncreating a dataset of full texts, and writing code to produce graphs. The argu-\nment here is that only a computational history can represent the full population\nin a statistical sense; anything else is just a biased sample.\n\u2022Genomic model: history is what DNA (and languages, and artifacts) show us.\nDavid Reich\u2019s Who We Are and How We Got Here is the canonical popular\nsummary of this school of thought, along with Cavalli-Sforza\u2019s older book on the\nHistory and Geography of Human Genes . The brief argument is: our true history\nis written in our genes. Mere texts can be faked, distorted, or lost, but genomics\n(modern or ancient) can\u2019t be. Languages and artifacts are a bit less robust in\nterms of the signal for historical reconstruction, though they often map to what\nthe new genomic studies are showing about patterns of ancient migrations.\n\u2022Tech Tree model: history is great men constrained by the adjacent possible . As\ncontext, the great man theory of history says that individuals like Isaac Newton46 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nand Winston Churchill shaped events. The counterargument says that these men\nwere carried on tides larger than them, and that others would have done the\nsame in their place. For example, for many (not all) Newtons, there is a Leibniz,\nwho could also have invented calculus. It\u2019s impossible to fullytest either of these\ntheories without a Lenski-like experiment where we re-run history with the same\ninitial conditions, but a useful model to reconcile the two perspectives is the tech\ntree from Civilization . Brie\ufb02y, all known science represents the frontier of the\ntree, and an individual can chooseto extend that tree in a given direction. There\nwasn\u2019t really a Leibniz for Satoshi, for example; at a time when others were\nfocused on social, mobile, and local, he was working on a completely di\ufb00erent\nparadigm. But he wasconstrained by the available subroutines, concepts like\nHashcash and chained timestamps and elliptic curves. Just like da Vinci could\nhave conceived a helicopter, but probably not built it with the materials then\navailable, the tech tree model allows for individual agency but subjects it to\nthe constraint of what is achievable by one person in a given era. The major\nadvantage of a tech tree is that (like the idea maze) it can be made visible, and\nnavigable, as has been done for longevity by the Foresight Institute.\nYou might \ufb01nd it a bit surprising that there are as many di\ufb00erent models for under-\nstanding history \u2014 let\u2019s call them historical heuristics \u2014 as there are programming\nparadigms. Why might this be so? Well, just like the idea of statecraft strategies that\nwe introduce later, the study of history can also be analogized to a type of program-\nming, or at least data analysis. That is, history is the analysis of the log \ufb01les.\n\u2022Data exhaust model: history as the analysis of the log \ufb01les . Here, we mean\n\u201clog \ufb01les\u201d in the most general sense of everything society has written down or\nleft behind; the documents, yes, but also the physical artifacts and genes and\nartwork, just like a log \u201c\ufb01le\u201d can contain binary objects and not just plain text.\nExtending the analogy, you can try to debug a program by \ufb02ying blind without\nthe logs, or alternatively you can try to look at every row of the logs, but rather\nthan either of these extremes you\u2019ll do best if you have a method for distilling\nthe logs into something actionable.\nAnd that\u2019s why historical heuristics exist. They are strategies for distilling insight from\nall the documents, genes, languages, transactions, inventions, collapses, and successes\nof people over time. History is the entire record of everything humanity has done. It\u2019s\na very rich data structure that we have only begun to even think of asa data structure.\nWe can now think of written history as an (incomplete, biased, noisy) distillation of\nthis full log. After all, if you\u2019ve ever found a reporter\u2019s summary of an eyewitness video\nto be wanting, or found a single video misleading relative to multiple camera angles,\nyou\u2019ll realize why having access to the fulllog of public events is a huge step forward.2.3.

The photo was shown via reverse image\nsearch to be taken by a photographer who had died in 2003, so it was more than\na decade old.

Whether these misrepresentations were made intentionally or out\nof \u201ctoo good to check\u201d carelessness, they were both attempts to exercise political power\nthat ran into the brick wall of technological truth. In the third example, the Chinese\npolitical system delegated the job of \ufb01nding out what was true to the blockchain.\nIn all three cases, technology provided a more robust means of determining what was\ntrue than the previous gold standards \u2014 whether that be the \u201cpaper of record\u201d or\nthe party-state.

Things like money, status,\nand borders are in this category. You can change these by rewriting facts in people\u2019s\nbrains. For example, the question of what a dollar is worth, who the president is, and\nwhere the border of a country is are all dependent on the ideas installed in people\u2019s\nheads. If enough people change their minds, markets move, presidents change, and\nborders shift.\nConversely, a technical truth is true even if no human believes it to be true. Facts\nin math, physics, and biochemistry are in this category. They exist independent of\nwhat\u2019s in people\u2019s brains. For example, what\u2019s the value of \u0019, the speed of light, or the\ndiameter of a virus?\nThose are the two extremes: political truths that you can change by rewriting the\nsoftware in people\u2019s brains, and technical truths that exist independent of that.", "num_tokens": 316}, "31": {"document": "2.3.5 A Balance of Political Power and Technological Truth\nOnce you reluctantly recognize that not everyaspect of a sociopolitical order can be\nderived from an objective calculation, and that some things really dodepend on an\narbitrary consensus, you realize that we need to maintain a balance between political\npower and technological truth.\nTowards this end, the Chinese have a pithy saying: the backwards will be beaten.\nIf you\u2019re bad at technology, you\u2019ll be beaten politically.

They believed in a way that\u2019s hard for us to understand, they thought\nof God as an active force in the world, \ufb01ring-and-brimstoning away. They wanted\ngod-fearing men in power, because a man who genuinely believed in God would behave\nwell even if no one could punish him.

At least,\nthis is a rational retro\ufb01tting of why being genuinely \u201cgod-fearing\u201d was important to\npeople, though they might not articulate it in quite that way. God was the ultimate\nforce, the Leviathan.\nBy the late 1800s, Nietzsche wrote that \u201cGod is dead.\u201d What he meant is that a critical\nmass of the intelligentsia didn\u2019t believe in God anymore, not in the same way their\nforefathers did.

These new faiths replaced g-o-d with g-o-v, faiths which\ncentered the State over God as the most powerful force on earth.\nThat brings us to the present. Now, today, as you can see from this graph and this\none, it is not just God that is dead. It is the State that is dying. Because here in the\nearly innings of the 21st century, faith in the State is plummeting. Faith in God has\ncrashed too, though there may be some inchoate revival of religious faith pending. But\nit is the Network \u2014 the internet, the social network, and now the crypto network \u2014\nthat is the next Leviathan.\nSo: in the 1800s you wouldn\u2019t steal because God would smite you, in the 1900s you\ndidn\u2019t steal because the State would punish you, but in the 2000s you can\u2019t steal\nbecause the Network won\u2019t let you.Either the social network will mob you, or2.4.

Here are several concrete examples\nwhere the Network\u2019s version of a given social practice is more powerful than the State\u2019s\nversion.\n1.Encryption > State Violence. When there is strong encryption government can\u2019t\ncrack, that means communications states can\u2019t eavesdrop on, transactions they\ncan\u2019t intercept, and digital borders they can\u2019t penetrate. It means nothing less\nthan the ability to organize groups outside state control, and thus a diminution\nin the power of states tocontrol.\n2.Cryptoeconomy > Fiat Economy. We just discussed this in the context of the\nNetwork\u2019s Bitcoin being money the State can\u2019t easily freeze, seize, ban, or print.\nIn theory this is just a special case of the point on encryption, but its implications\nare broad: all manner of \ufb01nancial instruments, corporate vehicles, accounting,\npayroll, and the like can be done on-chain outside the control of states.\n3.Peer-to-Peer > State Media. There are two kinds of state media: state-controlled\nmedia as in China\u2019s Xinhuanet, or state- controlmedia as in America\u2019s The New\nYork Times. The latter controls the state, the former is controlled by the state,\nbut both \ufb01ght freedom of speech. Network-facilitated P2P communication is\nanathema to them, particularly if end-to-end encrypted.

Social networks change many things, but a critical one is that\nthey change the nature of community. Your community is your social network,\nnot necessarily the people who live near you. When the network identity is more\nsalient than the neighor relationship, it challenges the very premise of the West-\nphalian state, which is that (a) people who live geographically near each other\nshare values and (b) therefore laws should be based on geographic boundaries.\nThe alternative is that only people who are geodesically near each other in the\nsocial network share values, and therefore the laws that govern them should be\nbased on network boundaries.\n5.Mobile > Sessile. Mobile is making us more mobile. And law is a function of\nlatitude and longitude; as you change your location, you change the local, state,\nand federal laws that apply to you. As such, migration is as powerful a way to\nchange the law under which you live as election. COVID-19 lockdowns may be\njust the beginning of State attempts to control Network-facilitated physical exit.2.4.

The Network allows you to work and communicate from\nanywhere. Combined with mobile, this further increases leverage against the\nState. The concept of the network state as a division of the world by people\nrather than by land is particularly important here, as network states are natively\nbuilt for getting voluntary subscription revenue from people around the world.\nThe diaspora isthe state.\n8.International > National. The Network gives people more of a choiceover what\nspeci\ufb01c State they are subject to. For example, they can move a server hosting\ntheir website from country to country with a few clicks.\n9.Smart Contracts > Law. The State\u2019s paper-based legal system is costly and\nunpredictable. A similar set of facts in two di\ufb00erent cities in the same country\ncould result in a di\ufb00erent ruling. Lawyers are expensive, paper contracts have\ntypos and illogic, and cross-border agreements range from complex to impossible.\nWe\u2019re still in the early days of smart contracts, but as we get well-debugged\nand formally-veri\ufb01ed contract libraries, this is an area where the Network is\npoised to take over from the State. Imagine truly international law: it\u2019s done\nprogrammatically rather than via pieces of paper, across borders outside the\ndomain of legacy states, and by global technologists rather than country-speci\ufb01c\nlawyers.\n10.Cryptographic Veri\ufb01cation > O\ufb03cial Con\ufb01rmation. Perhaps the most important\narena in which the Network is stronger than the state is in the nature of truth\nitself. As incredible as it may sound, the blockchain is the most important de-\nvelopment in history since the advent of writing itself, as it\u2019s a cryptographically\nveri\ufb01able, highly replicated, unfalsi\ufb01able, and provably complete digital record\nof a system. It\u2019s the ultimate triumph of the technological truth view of history,\nas there are now technical and\ufb01nancial incentives for passing down true facts,\nregardless of the sociopolitical advantages any given government might have for\nsuppressing them. To foreshadow a bit, this ledger of record is history written by\nthe Network rather than the State.\nThese examples can be multiplied. As mentioned before, Uber and Lyft are better\nregulators than the State\u2019s paper-based taxi medallions, email is superior to the USPS,\nand SpaceX is out-executing NASA. If you think about borders, you now need to think\nabout the Network\u2019s telepresence (which defeats physical borders) and its encryption\n(which erects digital borders). Or if you care about, say, the US census, the Network\ngives a real-time survey which is far more up to date than the State\u2019s 10 year process.54 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nIn short, if you can bring the Network to bear on an issue, it will often be the most\npowerful force. This is essentially what every startup founder does, all the time: they\ntry to \ufb01gure out the Network way of doing something, without going through the State.\nThere\u2019s an app for that!\nThis is conceptually important, because a startup society founder that can reposition\na particular con\ufb02ict such that it is the Network against the State has a chance to win.\nBut if they go through the legacy State, they\u2019ll be an alligator out of water, and they\nwill likely lose.\nNetwork > State: Trump\u2019s Deplatforming\nApplying the \u201cNetwork > State\u201d formulation to recent events, think about January\n2021, when \u2014 at the behest of the New York Times Company and all of mainstream\nmedia \u2014 Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter combined to deplatform a\nsitting president and disappear his supporters\u2019 app from the internet.\nThis was undeniable proof of the US government\u2019s impotence, because the \u201cmost pow-\nerful man in the world\u201d was clearly no longer even the most powerful man in his own\ncountry. The informal Network (the US establishment) trumped the formal State (the\nUS government).\nObviously, Trump and the Republicans weren\u2019t in control of events. Less obviously,\nelected Democrats weren\u2019t either. Oh, sure, many of them added their voices to the\ncacophony. But because the First Amendment constrains government capacity to re-\nstrain speech, they couldn\u2019t tell the tech CEOs to shut down opposition voices - but\nthe publishers could. And because the \ufb01nal control over these networks is in private\nhands, state o\ufb03cials didn\u2019t have the \ufb01nal say.\nPut another way, the people with their \ufb01ngers on the button are no longer elected\no\ufb03cials of the state.

Despite how competent the tech\nfounders of SF were on the Network, the political billionaires of the San Francisco\ncity government managed to use their control of the State to turn the city into a\nhellhole. Intentionally or not, this had the e\ufb00ect of driving out the new money,\ntheir potential competition.\nYes, there have been some successful tech-funded recall e\ufb00orts recently, but it\u2019s\nlikely too little, too late. It\u2019s akin to a stock price showing a bit of an upward\ntrend after a huge and irreversible drop. Because the Bay Area\u2019s monopoly is\nover. Technology has now globally decentralized into web3, and San Francisco\n(and even Silicon Valley) has now lost its position as the undisputed tech capital\nof the world. You no longer needto go to the Bay Area to build a startup \u2014 you\ncan found and fund from anywhere.\nThis is, on balance, a good thing \u2014 the fact that tech is no longer highly depen-\ndent on the triple dysfunction of SF/CA/USA is crucial to the world\u2019s future.\nNote also that while the defeat of tech in SF was due to State > Network, the\nreason tech lives to \ufb01ght another day is thanks to remote work, which allowed\nmovement away from SF in a \u201cTechxit.\u201d And remote work is a case of Network\n> State.\n2.CCP > Chinese tech founders. Until about 2018, Chinese tech founders were cel-\nebrated by the CCP. Imagine if Zuckerberg and Dorsey were given the equivalent\nof Senate seats for their contribution to the economy, brought into the estab-\nlishment rather than standing at a remove, and you\u2019ll get a sense of what the\ntone was like. Jack Ma (Alibaba founder), Pony Ma (Tencent founder), and their\npeers were either one of the 95 million CCP members (<7% of the country) or\npraised by CCP media.\nThen everything shifted. Just like America, China had its own establishment-\ndriven techlash.The huge cost of pausing of the massive ANT Financial IPO56 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\non some regulatory pretense was a signal. For the last several years, the CCP has\nput what it considers to be the \u201cnational interest\u201d over enormous sums of money,\nincurring at least a trillion dollars in cost for COVID lockdowns, shutdowns of\nIPOs, and overnight bans of entire industries like gaming and Bitcoin mining.\nThis looks stupid. Maybe it is stupid. Or maybe they know something we don\u2019t.\nTheCCP\u2019searlyactioninthe2000sand2010stobanforeignsocialnetworkslooks\nfarsightedinretrospect, asiftheyhadn\u2019tbuilttheirownWeiboandWeChat, then\nUS executives in Silicon Valley would have been able to deplatform (or surveil)\nanyone from China with a keystroke. So, unfortunately, perhaps signaling that\nthere are \u201cmore important things than money\u201d and gearing for con\ufb02ict will turn\nout to put the CCP in a better position for what comes.\nBe that as it may, the Chinese techlash is an example of \u201cState > Network.\u201d The\nCCP-controlled Chinese State beat the international Network of Chinese tech\nfounders. But it didn\u2019t win forever, as many of the most ambitious founders\nand funders in China are now using the Network to move abroad and escape the\nChinese State.\n3.Biasing AI with AI Bias. Jon Stokes has written at length about \u201cAI ethics\u201d\nand I\u2019d encourage you to read his work. But in brief, this entire pseudo\ufb01eld is\nabout putting a thumb on the scale of AI algorithms in the name of balancing\nthe scales, particularly at in\ufb02uential tech giants like Google. It\u2019s about ensuring\nthat members of the US establishment are always looking over the shoulder of\ntechnologists, making sure that their code is 100% regime compliant, just as\nthe Soviet Union did with its commissars, the NSDAP did with gleichschaltung ,\nand Xi has done with Xuexi Qiangguo .\nThe fundamental concept is about asserting moral control over a technological\n\ufb01eld. AI \u201cethics\u201d doesn\u2019t really contest what is true or false, it contests what is\ngood and bad. And what is bad? Anything that advances a politically unfavor-\nable narrative. As a concrete example, in 2021, Ukraine was widely reported to\nbe a corrupt country full of Azov Battalion Nazis. By mid 2022, those reports\nwould have been reclassi\ufb01ed as \u201cdisinformation\u201d and pushed down to page 10 of\nthe search results, if the AI bias people had their way.\nNow, the usual dodge is that there\u2019s always discretion involved in the selection\nof any machine learning training set, and judgment used in the con\ufb01guration of2.4. GOD, STATE, NETWORK 57\nany algorithm, so who is to say what \u201cunbiased\u201d means? But the goal here is\nto make sure that discretion does not scatter randomly, or at the discretion of\nthe individual investigator, but instead consistently points in a single \u201cethically\napproved\u201d direction, whether that be submission to NYT (in Blue America) or\nCCP (in China). It\u2019s centralized political control by another name.\nNote also that the name of their \ufb01eld has been chosen to ward o\ufb00 attack. What,\nare you against ethicsin AI? (These are the same people who speak mockingly\nof \u201cethics in journalism\u201d when it suits them.)\nSo, a better term for it is \u201cAI bias,\u201d not as in the studyof bias, but as in the\nstudy of how to bias AI. And the power the AI bias people have is enormous.\nA few zealots in the right places at big tech companies can and will distort\nthe Google results of billions of people, until and unless Google\u2019s monopoly is\ndisrupted, or unless the right people within Google push to make their algorithms\ntransparent.Newspeak isn\u2019t a dystopia for them, it\u2019s an instruction manual.\nAnd they might well win. The episode where Merriam-Webster changed the\ndictionaryinreal-timeforpoliticalpurposesisonlythebeginning; thenewGoogle\nis about to use its power to centrally change thought.\nThis is considerably worse than Baidu, which more straightforwardly \ufb01lters\nsearches that are \u201cproblematic\u201d for the CCP. Because the AI bias people pre-\ntend that they are doing it for the powerless, when they are really doing it to\nmaintain the US establishment\u2019s power.\n4.Digital Deplatforming. Another example of the State trumping the Network, of\npolitical power exercised against technological truth, can be seen in the muzzling\nof regime-disfavored voices on social media.\nAs always, this is obvious in China. Say something the CCP doesn\u2019t like on\nSina Weibo and your post disappears, and possibly your account and maybe\nyou\u2019re brought in for \u201ctea\u201d by the security forces. But in the West, if you say\nsomething the regime doesn\u2019t like on Twitter, your post disappears, and possibly\nyour account, and \u2014 in American protectorates like the UK \u2014 maybe you\u2019re\nbrought in for \u201ctea\u201d by the security forces.\nAh, didn\u2019t expect that, did you? But click those links. The only reason that\nUK-style hate speech laws haven\u2019tyet come to the US is the First Amendment,\nwhich has also limited to some degree the totality of private attempts at speech", "num_tokens": 2000}, "37": {"document": "and thought control.\nNevertheless, even by 2019 we could see the convergence of the American and\nChinese systems in this respect.

In the East it\u2019s o\ufb03cial government censorship, whereas in the West\nit\u2019s uno\ufb03cial private censorship, but that\u2019s not a substantive di\ufb00erence - it\u2019s\ncensorship as ordered by the Chinese and US establishments respectively. The\nsubstantive di\ufb00erence is that in the West there\u2019s a third faction of decentralized\ncensorship resistance.\nThe point is that sometimes Network > State (which is new), and sometimes State\n> Network (which is what most people expect), and the competition between these\nLeviathans will de\ufb01ne our time.\nBut is it always competition, or could it also be co-optation?", "num_tokens": 226}, "38": {"document": "2.4.5 Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis\nAs Larry Ellison put it, \u201cchoose your competitors carefully, because you\u2019ll become a lot\nlike them.\u201d This is a tech founder\u2019s version of the Hegelian dialectic, where thesis and\nantithesis mix to form a synthesis.\nIn other words, when you have three Leviathans (God, State, Network) that keep\nstruggling with each other, they won\u2019t remain pure forms.

And\nthere are a few di\ufb00erent ways to get to a Network/State fusion.\nThe \ufb01rst is the from-scratch version described in chapter one, where an internet leader\nbuilds a large enough network union online that it can crowdfund territory and eventu-\nally attain diplomatic recognition. But it\u2019s worth discussing other scenarios, where ex-\nisting governments fuse with the network \u2014 both positive and negative Network/State\nsyntheses.\nPositive Syntheses: BTC, Web3, E\ufb03ciency\nStart with the observation that companies, cities, currencies, communities, and coun-\ntries are all becoming networks.\nAs an analogy, we used to think of books, music, and movies as distinct. Then they\nall became represented by packets sent over the internet. Yes, we listened to music60 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nin audio players and viewed books in ebook readers, but their fundamental structure\nbecame digital.\nSimilarly, today we think of stocks, bonds, gold, loans, and art as di\ufb00erent. But all\nof them are represented as debits and credits on blockchains. Again, the fundamental\nstructure became digital.\nNow, we are starting to think of di\ufb00erent kinds of collections of people \u2013\u2014 whether\ncommunities, cities, companies, or countries \u2014\u2013 all fundamentally as networks, where\nthe digital pro\ufb01les and how they interact become more and more fundamental.\nThis is obvious for communities and companies, which can already be fully remote and\ndigital, but even already existing cities and countries are starting to be modeled this\nway, because (a) their citizensare often geographically remote, (b) the concept of\ncitizenship itself is becoming similar to digital single sign-on, (c) many 20th century\nfunctions of government have already been de-facto transferred to private networks like\n(electronic) mail delivery, hotel, and taxi regulation, (d) cities and countries increas-\ningly recruit citizens online, (e) so-called smart cities are increasingly administrated\nthrough a computer interface, and (f) as countries issue central bank digital currencies\nand cities likely follow suit, every polity will be publicly traded on the internet just like\ncompanies and coins.\nAnd that\u2019s just for pre-existing polities which retro\ufb01t themselves with aspects of the\nnetwork. It doesn\u2019t include the most fundamental network property of the de novo\nnetwork states described herein: namely that the citizenry itself\ufb01rst assembles in the\ncloud and only then crowdfunds the earth.\nExamples of pre-existing states integrating with the network include (a) El Salvador\u2019s\nintegration with the Bitcoin network, (b) Wyoming\u2019s decentralized autonomous or-\nganization (DAO) law and Norway\u2019s cap table bill, which are integrations with the\nEthereum network, and (c) places like Estonia and Singapore, where every government\nwork\ufb02ow is already online. In each of these cases, cities and states are fusing with\nnetworks to ship new services that are useful to citizens.\nThis is the benign version of the Network/State fusion, the one people will \ufb02ock to.\nNegative Syntheses: USG, CCP, Monopoly\nThe malign version of the Network/State fusion is what happened in China, and is\nhappening in America at the federal level with the tech crackdowns. In both the\nChinese and American cases the State is \u201cacquiring\u201d centralized technology companies\nat gunpoint, fusing with the Network from above.\nIn China the recipe was (a) a few years of media demonization plus (b) mandatory Xi\nJinping Thought sessions followed by (c) decapitation and quasi-nationalization \u2013\u2014 as\nis happening with Alibaba and ByteDance. In America during the techlash it was very2.4. GOD, STATE, NETWORK 61\nsimilar: (a) several years of media demonization plus (b) quasi-mandatory wokeness\nwithin followed by (c) anti-trust, regulation, and quasi-nationalization.\nSometimes the decapitation is forceful (Uber was an early target here) and sometimes\nit\u2019s quasi-voluntary. Indeed, one thesis on why many of the major tech founders have\nstepped down as of mid-2022, other than Zuck, is that they don\u2019t want to become\npersonally demonized during the no-win antitrust process. It\u2019s more explicit in China\nthat this wasn\u2019t a choice \u2014 Jack Ma is no longer in control of the company he founded,\nand many other Chinese founders have been similarly relieved of their duties.\nInotherwords, boththeChineseandAmericanestablishmentshaveinventedrationales\nto essentially seize previously founder-controlled companies.\nThat is, whatever the surface justi\ufb01cation, these are hostile takeovers of centralized\ntech companies by centralized states. Once taken over, these companies will be turned\ninto total surveillance machines and tools of social control. In China, this is already\nobvious.

And a good\nchunk of reds will remain loyal to the State; let\u2019s call them secular nationalists.\nSo if and when things line up as Network vs State, if there\u2019s a highly in\ufb02ationary event\nthat pits the orange Bitcoin against the green Dollar, we may see an acceleration of\nthe ongoing realignment. Many blues will line up with grays and reds on the side of\nthe international Network, and many reds will side with blues to defend the centralized\nAmerican State.\nLet\u2019s explain.\nBlue Tribe: Left-Authoritarians, Left-Libertarians\nEach member of blue tribe will have to make a choice in the years to come: are they\nloyal to neutral decentralized networks that treat both Americans and non-Americans\nequally,oraretheyactuallyjustloyaltotheUSestablishment\u2014essentiallynationalists\nin disguise? Is their de\ufb01nition of \u201cdemocracy\u201d commensurate with a world where the\n4% (namely the Americans) rule the 96% (namely the non-Americans), in\ufb02ating away\nthe globe\u2019s savings, destroying local cultures, and surveilling the world at all times? Or\ndo they believe the rest of the world deserves digital self-determination? In short, will64 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nthe internationally-minded liberal choose the decentralized Network or the centralized\nState?\nTo understand this choice, let\u2019s orient ourselves. The blue tribe is the most powerful\nin Western society today, and has twomain internal factions: the left-authoritarians\nwho worship the State, and the left-libertarians who are (unconsciously) people of the\nNetwork.\nWokeness is a Doctrine, not a Religion\nBefore we begin, we need to understand that the blue belief system of \u201cWokeness\u201d isn\u2019t\nexactly a religion. It\u2019s a doctrine, and it includes both people of the State and the\nNetwork.\nThat is, while it\u2019s become popular to talk about Wokeness as a religion, and while\nthereissomething to this, it\u2019s more precise to talk about it as a doctrine: namely, \u201ca\nbelief or set of beliefs held and taught by a church, political party, or other group.\u201d\nThe concept of a doctrine encompasses religious andpolitical beliefs, both God- and\nState-worship. And nowadays the \u201cother group\u201d could be a Network entity of some\nkind, like a social network or cryptocurrency.\nSo now we have an umbrella term: doctrine. God-worshippers have religions (reli-\ngious doctrines), State-loyalists have political parties (with political doctrines), and\nNetwork-centrists have social networks or cryptocurrencies (with tightly enforced con-\ntent moderation or crypto tribalism respectively, which are network doctrines). Each\ndoctrine has a Leviathan, a most powerful force. And a religion is then just a type of\ndoctrine.\nWith this de\ufb01nition, we can return to the question: is capital-W Wokeness, like Com-\nmunism and Nazism before it, a religion that evolved to jump over the formal principle\nof church/state separation by posing as a non-religion? Well, as several have now ob-\nserved, Wokeness doeshave cognates to many aspects of Christianity \u2014 we all have\nthe Calvinist original sin of bigotry, we\u2019re going to the warm hell of climate change\nunless we repent, unbelievers must \u201crecant,\u201d heresy must be suppressed, the West\u2019s\nbeliefs must be evangelized at gunpoint, and so on. See Curtis Yarvin\u2019s How Dawkins\nGot Pwned , John McWhorter\u2019s Woke Racism , Andrew Sullivan on America\u2019s New Re-\nligions, Noah Smith on Wokeness as Old-Time Religion , Tom Holland\u2019s concluding\nchapter in Dominion , Paul Graham on Heresy, and Michael Shellenberger and Peter\nBoghossian\u2019s detailed infographic for perspectives on this topic.\nButwhileit\u2019sdirectionallyaccurate, callingwokenessareligiondoesn\u2019t quite\ufb01tbecause\nthe wokes have a di\ufb00erent theory of the prime mover. Wokeness is better termed a\ndoctrine, because it\u2019s actually crucial to note that wokes do notworship God; instead,\none faction of wokes worships the State and the other is, less consciously, people of2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 65\nthe Network. These internal denominational splits are de\ufb01ned by choice of Leviathan.\nAndthey\u2019llbeimportantintheescalatingcon\ufb02ictbetweenStateandNetwork, between\nDollarandBitcoin,betweenestablishmentjournalistsanddecentralizedmedia,between\nthe American government and the global internet, as these divisions promise to split\nblue team in two.\nBlue State: Left-Authoritarians\nFortheleft-authoritariansamongtheblues, theirprimaryLeviathanistheState, which\nisveryrealandcandoviolenceagainstits/theirenemies, asopposedtowhattheythink\nof as an imaginary God. This is why State-worshippers mock the concept of \u201cthoughts\nand prayers\u201d in favor of \u201cpassing a law.\u201d The State exists, after all, and can organize\npeople to apply coercive force. But God\u2019s vehicle, the church, no longer has enough\nbelief behind it (in the West at least) to do the same.\nThis is also why left-authoritarians tend to take for granted that all ills can be solved\nby \u201cpraying for relief\u201d to the State, by forming some agency, by appropriating ever\nmore money. Taxes are secular tithes, and the Gov-fearing man is like the God-fearing\nman \u2014 you simply cannot pay enough money and respect to the state, because as the\nDNC video says outright, \u201cgovernment is the one thing we all belong to.\u201d It\u2019s not about\nresults, it\u2019s about fealty.\nEven though they culturally love the State and hate the Network, it\u2019s important to\nnote that the left-authoritarians in the US havemanaged to recently take control of\nbig chunks of the Network, through placing sympathizers in key positions at Big Tech\ncompanies during the techlash and Great Awokening of the 2010s. (There are incipient\nsigns of pushback here, though, at places like Net\ufb02ix and even Google, where the very\nwokest are being terminated.)\nWhat do left-authoritarians generally look like from an occupational standpoint? The\nbody of left-authoritarians are the NPCs paying the NYT monthly subscriptions for the\no\ufb03cial \u201ctruth,\u201d slavishly turning their heads with every new software update, insisting\nthat masks don\u2019t work before they do, reliably surging behind the current thing. These\nare just foot soldiers, but interestingly the most important left-authoritarians aren\u2019t\nthe elected o\ufb03cials.\nAsYarvininparticularhasdocumentedatlength,themostimportantleft-authoritarians\nare not formally part of the elected State at all. They are the professors, activists, bu-\nreaucrats, and journalists.\nThe key concept is that much of America\u2019s control circuitry has evolved to live outside\nthe formal state, thereby making it resistant to displacement by democratic election.\nThey laud \u201cdemocracy\u201d but avoid it in practice, through dual class stock, tenure for", "num_tokens": 1988}, "45": {"document": "their bureaucrats and professors, tax-exempt compounding for their foundations, and\nideological puri\ufb01cation of their organizations. As with the communists who endlessly\nburbled about their \u201cdemocratic people\u2019s republics\u201d while eschewing elections, the left-66 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nauthoritarians don\u2019t actually subject their control of key institutions to a vote.\nThere are di\ufb00erent names for this left-authoritarian network that controls the state\nfrom outside by \u201cholding it accountable.\u201d We can call it the Paper Belt (which em-\nphasizes their Rust-Belt-like technological backwardness), we can call it the Cathedral\n(which emphasizes their holiness), we can call it the regime (which emphasizes their\nillegitimacy), or we can call it simply the American establishment (which emphasizes\ntheir enduring power). Later we will call it NYT/USD, to emphasize their source of\ntruth and digital economy relative to BTC/web3 and CCP/RMB.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that the power of the left-authoritarians comes from\ngettingtheo\ufb03cialsofthecentralizedAmericanStateand(morerecently)theexecutives\nof the centralized Big Tech Network to crush their enemies.\nThemaintechniqueisto\u201cmanipulateproceduraloutcomes\u201d, oftenbygettingsomething\ntrue to be o\ufb03cially deemed disinformation (as in the example of the pre-2020 election\nlaptop story), or conversely getting something false to be deemed o\ufb03cial truth (as\nin the case of the Cambridge Analytica story). The left-authoritarians are the main\nproponents of the political power theory of truth, as \u201ctruth\u201d is whatever they \ufb01nd\nhelpful to move political power into action.\nWhen an employee of a media corporation talks about an article having \u201cimpact,\u201d for\nexample, they mean impact in the sense of a government truncheon impacting your\nhead, via a new rule or regulation. Go read the descriptions of the prizes they award\nto each other, and you\u2019ll see them celebrate themselves for making something that was\npreviously volitional newly mandatory or forbidden. \u201cOur report led to government\naction!\u201d Whether that action was the bombing of Libya or the banning of plastic\nstraws makes no nevermind; impact is impact.\nLaws aren\u2019t the only form of impact. Getting someone \ufb01red is too. We talk of hit\npieces and cancel culture as if they\u2019re aberrations, but they\u2019re actually the core of\nleft-authoritarian culture. Recall that the most prestigious thing any establishment\njournalist ever did was Watergate: namely, getting a president \ufb01red while selling mil-\nlions of copies of their newspaper.\nThis episode has been endlessly romanticized, but here\u2019s a di\ufb00erent perspective on\nit: the corporate takeover of America we\u2019re supposed to be constantly vigilant for\nactually already occured 50 years ago, just from the left, when a few privately-owned\nmedia corporations cooperated to get Nixon \ufb01red and the Pentagon Papers leaked,\nproving that the control circuitry outsidethe State was upstream of the mere elected\ngovernment and US military.\nNow, was Watergate a crime? Sure, but worse than the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution?\nWorse than the Nasiriyah testimony? Worse than WMD? Worse than the lies used to2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 67\ndrive America\u2019s many wars? And, relevantly, worse than what JFK did to get elected?\nAfter all, contra his protestations, Nixon may well have been a crook, but as Seymour\nHersh has convincingly reported, so was John F. Kennedy \u2014 yet the exposure of his\nWatergate-level election shenanigans somehow waited till thirty years after he ascended\nto the presidency over one Richard Milhous Nixon.\nAnyway, the problem isn\u2019t just the asymmetry of the \u201caccountability\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s not\nreally about hypocrisy, but hierarchy. The problem with America\u2019s left-authoritarians\nis also that they\u2019ve built a terrible culture. A society that puts Watergate on a pedestal\nis just fundamentally di\ufb00erent from one that puts NASA (or SpaceX) on a pedestal.\nBecause if what\u2019s applauded is putting a man out of work, rather than putting a man\nonthemoon, therewillbealotofcancellationandnotalotofcreation. Firingsomeone\nshould be a necessary evil, not the highest good.\nWe linger on Watergate because it was the moment when the left-authoritarian Amer-\nican Network outside the State became unambiguously ascendant. It was the public\ndemonstrationofaverydi\ufb00erentmodelfromtheleft-authoritarianSoviets. TheSoviets\nhad a state-controlled press, but America now had a press-controlled state.\nAfter Watergate, the left-authoritarians knew that they were the boss of the boss, that\nthey could get the president \ufb01red, that they could \u201chold someone accountable\u201d \u2014 and,\nconversely, that no one could really hold themaccountable in any way. For example,\nwhat was the punishment for printing the \u201cdisinformation\u201d that led to, say, the Iraq\nWar, or the Holodomor? Suspension from social media? Reparations for the dead? Or\nnothing? Much easier to pin it all on a single Nixon, or even a Stalin for that matter,\nthan a decentralized mass of nameless left-authoritarians.\nTwo additional points before we move on from our God/State/Network-informed anal-\nysis of the left-authoritarians. First, more recently, as American state capacity has\ndeclined, the left-authoritarians have shifted their targets to the new authorities: the\nCEOs of tech companies in particular. They realize on some level that (a) Network >\nState in many contexts and furthermore that (b) the Network-aided global ascent of\ntech founders and populist leaders could reduce their control over the State, so they\nhave chosen to (c) strike \ufb01rst by gaining control of those tech companies that have\nachieved state-like scale.\nTheirmodus operandi wasmuchthesameasitisforin\ufb02uencingtheState: usereporting\nto harass tech executives into \ufb01ring people that left-authoritarians don\u2019t like, then push\nthem to enact policies that left-authoritarians dolike \u2014 such as \u201ccontent moderation\u201d\nover any message other than that emanating from approved establishment outlets. The\nleft-authoritarians have even admitted to this in unguarded moments; see for example\nthis character talking about how \u201cjournalism is about raw power\u201d or this admission\nthat the media\u2019s explicit goal was to use the State as a billy club against the Network\nfor fun and pro\ufb01t.68 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nSecond, an important insight is that behind many of these left-authoritarian journalists\n(andactivistsandnonpro\ufb01ts)isanold-moneyzillionaire, anepotisticheirofsomekind.\nYou won\u2019t \ufb01nd someone at The Atlantic criticizing Laurene Powell Jobs, you won\u2019t \ufb01nd\nsomeoneatNPRgoingafterSoros, andyouwon\u2019t\ufb01ndsomeoneatTheNewYorkTimes\nCompany that even publicly admitsthat their boss, Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, is a rich\nwhite male nepotist. This puts their behavior into stark relief: the left-authoritarian\nwants to get you \ufb01red, or get your boss to \ufb01re you, but won\u2019t even mention their boss.\nThey are fundamentally just dogs on a leash, hit men for old money, assassins for the\nestablishment.\nBlue Network: Left-Libertarians\nThere is a split among blue Americans. Some of them, the left-libertarians, are actually\nbest modeled as people of the Network \u2014 meaning, the social network. They truly\naren\u2019t primarily loyal to the Democrat party or even the institutions that are upstream\nof it, but to their community online \u2014 which increasingly diverges from the party line.\nThese are the deplatformed sex workers, the ones engaging in risky public activism\nrather than the ones merely funding it, the anarchists, the journalists so consistent\nin their beliefs that they\u2019re actually striking against their nepotistic owners, and the\nethical anti-imperialists. They really don\u2019tidentify with the US establishment that\nmuch, even if they sometimes wish it would execute the redistribution strategy of their\ndreams. Their primary people are the others in their social network. And that Network\nis becoming their new Leviathan.\nFor the professional protester, for example, they can use the o\ufb04ine tactics from Beau-\ntiful Trouble orRoots to Power to laboriously organize an in-person procession outside", "num_tokens": 1998}, "46": {"document": "a government o\ufb03ce...or they can do the same thing online by simply posting a hash-\ntag and materializing a digital crowd, then going direct with their cause rather than\nnegotiating with an establishment journalist for exposure. So what\u2019s giving them more\nleverage these days: the institutions that surround the legacy State, or the features of\nthe decentralized Network?\nAnother factor pushing left-libertarians away from the US establishment is the strong\nleft-authoritarian shift towards holiness over coolness. Fredrik DeBoer actually dis-\ncussed this shift while it was underway, while society was still transitioning from the\nold-time religion of Judeo-Christianity to the new doctrine of wokeness:\nSilicon Valley types, by contrast, believe in things...Tangible values about\nprogress and culture. The Californian ideology plus the blockchain or what-\never. There\u2019s content there...\nThe media has none of that. The old school media values of truth telling\nand muckraking have long since been abandoned by the media itself, as real\nvalues require sincerity and media culture abhors sincerity. You can\u2019t sit\non Twitter all day telling shitty jokes about how nothing matters and then\nturn around and say \u201cbut also we\u2019re the guardians of truth and democracy.\u201d2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 69\nIf Silicon Valley has captured the value of media for shareholders and is\nslowly strangling the industry to death, righting the course will require\npeople within media who are willing to stand up and say, \u201cHere are my\nvalues. They are what they are. I embody them without irony and thus I\nam vulnerable. If you value these things too you have to \ufb01ght to save our\nindustry.\u201d Suchapositionwouldrequireawillingnesstoleaveblanksarcasm\naside and to start writing again for the world instead of only writing to\nappear clever to other writers. Can the media make this kind of move? I\ndon\u2019t see how they can; the social capture of the entire industry is just far\ntoo acute.\nAs smart as this post was, things didn\u2019t work out quite as DeBoer expected. The push\ntoward sincerity \u2014 towards \ufb01lling that God-shaped hole \u2014 ended up cleaving the blues\nin two.\nThat is, contra DeBoer\u2019s forecast (\u201cI don\u2019t see how they can\u201d), some of the earnest\nblues actually diddeclare themselves champions of \u201cmoral clarity\u201d, and have now gone\nover purely to unironic State-worship, to applauding multi-day prayer vigils with Liz\nCheney for the wrongs visited upon their sacred Capitol. As Glenn Greenwald has\nwritten about at length, there\u2019s no daylight anymore between the Democrats and the\nDepartment of Defense, no criticism of the Central Intelligence Agency by CNN.\nThis fusion wasn\u2019t the full communism that DeBoer sometimes claims to prefer, but it\nwas a fulsome declaration of values by the medianevertheless. It\u2019s the culmination of\nthe trend towards devout wokeness that Scott Alexander identi\ufb01ed years ago in \u201cGay\nRites are Civil Rites.\u201d The left-authoritarians have done to wokeness in a few years\nwhat Nietzsche noted had been done to Christianity over the span of eons: namely,\nthey\u2019ve transformed it from a revolutionary ideology into a ruling-class ideology.\nBut every action has a reaction, every activity spawns a Soros-like re\ufb02exivity, and Scott\nAlexander was actually ahead of the curve again here as well. Before \u201cGay Rites are\nCivil Rites\u201d, he also identi\ufb01ed a second dynamic of relevance, the trend awayfrom\ndevout wokeness that he described in \u201cRight is the new Left.\u201d And this brings us to\nback to the left-libertarians.\nThe kind of blue that listens to Gray Zone, Red Scare, or Jimmy Dore is repelled by\nState worship. They don\u2019t wantto choose something as down the middle as pledging\nallegiancetotheAmerican\ufb02agandthenationalsecuritystateforwhichitstands. They\nactually believed the things they said against the establishment, and don\u2019t endorse it\nsimply because it\u2019s ostensibly \u201ctheir\u201d team now wearing the NSA headsets.70 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nBlue State vs Blue Network\nThe left-libertarian subgroup of blues has begun to \ufb02irt with decentralized media and\nweb3, because they\u2019re realizing the Network could be more interesting than the declin-\ning American State. Could Substack be more remunerative than Sulzberger? Could\nSatoshi\u2019s community deliver more for them than Bernie\u2019s? If they need to rede\ufb01ne\nall that as \u201csocialism,\u201d so be it! And if their funding stream is changing, their ide-\nology is slowly shifting too. Yes, they may have startedas mere pawns of America\u2019s\nleft-authoritarian establishment, but what they value is increasingly coming from the\ndecentralized global Network rather than the centralized American State. So they are\nbeginning to uncouple. And that\u2019s the emerging Network-vs-State division within blue\ntribe.\nRed Tribe: Secular Nationalists, Internationalist Capitalists\nEach member of red tribe, the conservatives, will also have to make a choice in the\nyears to come: do they believe in the founding principles encoded in the Bill of Rights\nand the Constitution, or will they simply enforce whatever edicts emanate from an\nincreasingly malign US establishment \u2014 supporting statists in practice? Is their def-\ninition of \u201cAmerica\u201d commensurate with a world where the US federal government is\nitself the most determined opponent of liberty, in\ufb02ating away their savings, decon-\nstructing conservative America\u2019s culture, and surveilling them at all times? Or do they\nbelieve American cities and states deserve digital self-determination? In short, will the\nAmerican nationchoose the decentralized Network or the centralized State?\nThis will eventually be a conscious choice. Right now, it\u2019s an unconscious three-way\nsplit. The three-legged stool of Reaganism \u2014 the religious conservatives, the secu-\nlar nationalists, and the internationalist capitalists \u2014 side with the God, State, and\nNetwork Leviathans respectively.\nThese are their primary identities, because they correspond to that thing which they\nthink of as the most powerful force in the world: almighty God, the US military, or\n(implicitly) the global network of trade and communication that will soon simply be\nidenti\ufb01ed with cryptocurrency.\nRed God: Religious Conservatives\nDuring the Cold War, religious conservatives believed in an almighty God, unlike the\n\u201cgodless communists\u201d they fought against. Today, the people of God among the reds\nhave sharply reduced numbers, but their moral compass remains the man on high.\nInsofar as there is a religious revival, it may be driven by the One Commandment-\nbased startup societies we describe later on. See Rod Dreher on the Protestants,\nAdrian Vermeule and Sohrab Ahmari on the Catholics, and Tablet\u2019s Big Tent to get a\nsense of their views.2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 71\nRed State: Secular Nationalists\nThe people of the State among the reds are more prominent. These are the secu-\nlar nationalists, the national security hawks, the people who may not like the left-\nauthoritarians but who will nevertheless re\ufb02exively support the US in every foreign\nintervention. They may agree that the US is trending in a bad direction, but they\nthink China is far worse. As such, they\u2019re still building drones, coding surveillance,\nandcheeringvideoslikethisonewheretheUSadmitstofomentingthecolorrevolutions\nthat are often otherwise denied.\nI\u2019m somewhat sympathetic to this group \u2014 after all, they aren\u2019t burning their own\ncountry down! \u2014 but unfortunately, on foreign policy they are helping to burn down\notherpeople\u2019s countries, and often for no good reason.\nThe issue is that in the absence of a compelling alternative, or an undeniable collapse,\nyou\u2019re simply not going to convince a secular nationalist that America and China are\nbothbecoming digital totalitarian states, or that a US establishment that has pushed\nhalf a dozen countries into murderous chaos isn\u2019t quite the moral exemplar that they\nthink it is.\nThe reason is becausethe red statist is a secular nationalist: they don\u2019t have a God,\nbut they do believe in the State, the good vision of America as a shining city on a hill.\nIt really doesn\u2019t matter if this doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 it\u2019s the USA from their youth and from\ntheir movies. It\u2019s Top Gun", "num_tokens": 1997}, "47": {"document": "America, and they\u2019ll keep paying to watch the inspiring\nremakes, not the depressing footage of what the US military actually did in Iraq, Libya,\nAfghanistan, and Syria.\nThere\u2019s both a laudable aspect to this kind of loyalty, and a frustrating one. These\nfolks are like the Soviet soldiers that dutifully served in Afghanistan. You might argue\nthey\u2019re \ufb01ghting for a cause that is at best pointless and at worst evil, and that they\u2019ll\nonly come home to \ufb01nd their shelves empty and their culture crushed...but you have\nto acknowledge they\u2019re risking their lives regardless.\nFundamentally, the red secular nationalist often understands how bad the US estab-\nlishment is at home, but doesn\u2019t want to hear about the needless destruction wreaked\nby the US military abroad. In this they have the opposite set of blind spots from the\nblue left-libertarian, who can clearly see the ruin of countries unfortunate enough to\nexperience a 21st century US \u201cintervention,\u201d yet imagines the same government that\u2019s\na chaotic destroyer abroad can become a benevolent redistributor at home.\nIn other words, while the red secular nationalist maintains an implicit Hollywood-\nmovie-style belief in a US military that can beat up anyone, the blue left-libertarian\npersists in their belief that the State\u2019s civilian government could\ufb01x anything at home\nif only enough people willed it. Using the lens of the Leviathans, these are both clearly\nwaystheStatebecomesastand-inforGod, initsterribleFatherandbenevolentMother\nforms respectively.72 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nWhat about China, huh?\nLet\u2019s digress and engage the China point for a second, as it\u2019s the go-to argument of\nthe red secular nationalist. To paraphrase, the red nationalist often concedes that US\nmilitary intervention abroad has been regrettable, but CCP dominance would be so\nmuch worse that we need the US military to not just stick around but to expand and\ngrow stronger.\nThe short counterargument is that it may instead be best for countries to rearm, and\ntake on their own defense \u2013 rather than having an increasingly chaotic US try to \ufb01ght\na Second Cold War on others\u2019 behalf in the middle of an internal Cold Civil War and\nwhat might become a Second Great Depression.\nThat is, we get there by a di\ufb00erent route, but we arrive at much the same conclusion as\nan isolationist rightist or an anti-imperialist leftist. Whether you think America is too\ngood for the world, or whether you think it\u2019s an ill e\ufb00ect on countries abroad, or some\ncomplex combination of both, we may want (and observe) US military withdrawal and\nregional rearmament rather than a Second Cold War.\nWhat\u2019s the long-form version of the argument? Start with the observation that the\nCCPismore oppressive at home than the US establishment, but it\u2019s also empirically\nless destructive abroad.\nWhy? Not because of benevolence, but because the CCP is checked by the US military\nabroad. Thus China is focused on building up Africa while America is blowing up the\nMiddle East. Yes, you can argue the Chinese are building colonies in Africa...but\nthey\u2019re functional colonies, with new roads and ports to carry raw materials, unlike the\nblasted hellscapes left by US military intervention in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and the like.\nWith that said, we should have no illusions: China\u2019s neighbors in Southeast Asia know\nthe dragon would throw its weight around without a US military presence. Right now\nit can\u2019t, because China is boxed in by the US military. Conversely, at home the CCP\nhas no organized domestic political opposition, so it can be absolutely ruthless.\nThe US establishment has the opposite set of constraints: unlike China, it doesn\u2019t face\norganized military opposition abroad, so it\u2019s highly incautious in its foreign policy. But\nalso unlike the CCP it doesface organized domestic political opposition at home, so it\ncan\u2019t be as ruthless domestically as it wantsto be.\nLet\u2019s drill into the domestic point \ufb01rst, and then the military point.\nIt\u2019s really crucial to understand that the US establishment is notmore ethical than\nthe CCP when it comes to civil liberties. It\u2019s just less competent! After all, the US\nestablishment also does warrantless surveillance via the NSA, unconstitutional search\nandseizureviatheTSA,arbitrarycon\ufb01scationofpropertyviacivilforfeiture, andsoon.\nAnd that\u2019s just what\u2019s already been rolled out \u2014 the ambitions of the US establishment\nare just as totalitarian as the Chinese state\u2019s, as we can see from its partially failed\nattempts at disinformation agencies, civilian disarmament, digital censorship, and the\nlike.

The US establishment isn\u2019t organized enough to coordinate\nall the pieces, but unfortunately the recently captured Google, Amazon, Apple, and\nMicrosoft arecapable of that level of coordination, as we saw during the Parler deplat-\nforming, and the Tiananmen-like censorship of the \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d So we\u2019ll see what\nhappens.\nNow on the military point.\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet constraint meant the US was more cautious in its\ninterventions, and actually generally achieved far better results. South Korea was\nbetter o\ufb00 than North Korea, West Germany was better o\ufb00 than East Germany, and\nTaiwan was better o\ufb00 than Maoist China. Even given all the lies on all sides around\nVietnam, had the US won in South Vietnam, it\u2019s quite possible that would have been\na South Korea too; but because it lost, countless people had to \ufb02ee and communism\nclaimed many lives in Southeast Asia.\nAfter the Cold War ended, however, the US military became a hyperpower - and\ngradually evolved into a global fomenter of chaos rather than the generally conservative\nguardian of stability it was before 1991. The Iraq War can be seen as a transition point,\nascanSamanthaPower\u2019sR2PdoctrinethatleftSyriainruins. By2022, thequestionof\nwhether America produces chaos with its military interventions can hardly be gainsaid\n\u2014 even the most committed American nationalist is hard pressed to name a country\nthat\u2019sbettero\ufb00 after a recentUS military intervention, something that wasn\u2019t that\nhard to do from 1945-1991.\nOK, so let\u2019s put it all together.\nThereistruth to the idea that the US military is checking China, and that China\nwould act more aggressively in the absence of the US military...but it\u2019s true in the\nsame way the Soviet military was once checking the US, and then the US military\nacted more aggressively in the absence of the Soviet military. That is, it\u2019s true that\nthe Soviet military was on balance nota force for good during 1945-1991, but it\u2019s also\ntrue that the US military has on balance notbeen a force for good during 1991-2021.\nIt\u2019scomplicated. EveniftheirmilitarydidinsomesenserestraintheUSfromrandomly\nblowing up the Middle East, it\u2019s tough to argue that you\u2019d still want the Soviet Union\nto still be around to limit US military intervention. Similarly, it\u2019s hard to contend that\nthe price of constraining China\u2019s lawful evil ambitions in East Asia should be tolerance\nfor America\u2019s chaotic evil interventions in the Middle East, that defending against a74 CHAPTER 2.

This has its own issues, of course \u2014 but if\nwe\u2019re moving back into the 1800s and 1700s, as per the Future is Our Past thesis, lim-\nited wars between gold-limited great powers are arguably preferable to gigantic global\ncon\ufb02icts between unlimited superpowers.\nIn short: the secular American nationalist has an option that doesn\u2019t involve either\ncapitulating to China or pretending the US military is currently achieving fruitful\nthings abroad. That third way is to support regional rearmament rather than \ufb01ghting\neveryone else\u2019s wars on their behalf.\nRed Network: Internationalist Capitalists", "num_tokens": 1999}, "48": {"document": "Getting back to our original topic, the third group within red tribe are the interna-\ntionalist capitalists. We identify them as people of the Network. This is arguably\nsomething of a retcon, because the internet as we currently know it was barely a factor\nduring the Cold War.However, this subgroup involved the folks in favor of commerce\nand trade networks, both within and across borders \u2014 the capitalists.\nToday, that kind of capitalism is almost synonymous with internet startups and tech-\nnology. The most valuable companies in the world were born on the Network. And\nthe future of network capitalism is crypto-capitalism, because it\u2019s not just transactions\nthat can be represented on-chain \u2014 it\u2019s entire \ufb01nancial statements, and companies\nthemselves, and eventually the entire economy.\nThe rise of Bitcoin means red people of the Network have a very speci\ufb01c way to think\nabout their Leviathan, something distinct from both God and the State. Because BTC\ncannot be seized with one click by either the US or Chinese governments, it\u2019s a symbol\nof international freedom and prosperity that is more powerful than any State.\nOn balance, I\u2019m sympathetic to this group as well, but it has its own internal issues.\nFor one thing, Bitcoin Maximalism in particular is similar to Woke Capital in its funda-\nmentalism. The main di\ufb00erence is that maximalism is zealous mononumism (devotion\nto a single coin) rather than monotheism (a single god) or monostatism (a single state).\nThe Network doesn\u2019t make the fanatical aspect of humanity vanish; it just moves it\nfrom God or the State to the Network.\nRed State vs Red Network\nWe now see that the God, State, and Network Leviathans all have their supporters\nwithin the conservative movement.2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 75\nAn interesting point is that secular nationalists, being dispositionally conservative, can\noften stick with a symbol long after its substance has changed. Think about the many\n\u201cRussian nationalists\u201d who stuck with the Soviet Union even when it was a complete\ninversion of what had existed prior to 1917. Then compare this US Army ad from 2008\nwith this recent ad from 2021.\nSo, in the event of any con\ufb02ict between the Network and the State, such as a possible\nstruggle between the in\ufb02ating dollar and the de\ufb02ationary Bitcoin, the right-statists\ncould take the side of the national \ufb02ag while the right-capitalists take the side of the\ndigital currency. That is, if and when it\u2019s clear that the continuation of American\nempire depends on the ability to continually in\ufb02ate, the people of the State may side\nwith the legacy state, and the people of the Network will side with the decentralized\nnetwork.So, that\u2019s the Network-vs-State division within red tribe.\nThe Realignment\nIf we add up all these pieces, we get a possible future where the left- and right-\nlibertarians from both parties line up against the left- and right-authoritarians.\nWe\u2019re already starting to see this if we look at Substack vs establishment journal-\nists, Tucker Carlson and Glenn Greenwald vs Fox News/NYT, BTC vs USD, web3 vs\nBig Tech, the migration of ethnic minorities to the Republicans and the migration of\nneoconservatives to the Democrats.\nPeople have talked about zombie Reaganism, but in this scenario a new coalition would\nbe \ufb01nally popping into view. And it\u2019s a totally di\ufb00erent carving of the political spec-\ntrum than the Reagan era. Rather than nationalists and capitalists (the right) against\ninternationalists and socialists (the left), it\u2019s internationalists and capitalists (left- and\nright-libertarians) against socialists and nationalists (left- and right-authoritarians).\nThat Realignment would be the Network against the State. The authoritarians would\noutnumber the libertarians domestically, and have the institutions on their side. But\nthe libertarians would have stronger individual talent, as they\u2019d draw the iconoclasts,\nand they\u2019d also draw support from the rest of the world.", "num_tokens": 938}, "49": {"document": "2.5.2 Tech vs Media, aka PC vs PC\nLet\u2019s switch gears here and apply the lens of the Leviathans to a di\ufb00erent con\ufb02ict.\nWhy are global technology and the US establishment at odds?\n\u2022Economics.

This relates to the distinction\nbetween technical and political truths.\n\u2022Metabolism. You might observe that the rivalry is particularly pronounced be-\ntweenUStechandmedia. TheotherarmsoftheUSestablishment, likeacademia,\nHollywood, and government all needed multi-year cycles to ship anything, while\nonly the news media had the 24/7 metabolism to match tech\u2019s DNA. So they\nbecame the point of the spear for the US establishment\u2019s counterattack. This\nis also why tech favors newsletters, podcasts, slide decks, and other types of\nfast-turnaround content that the establishment doesn\u2019t natively specialize in.\n\u2022Bifurcation. You can remark that there\u2019s a deep structural similarity between\na socialist professor and technologist founder: both feel like they should be in\ncharge. That\u2019s why tech is a cultural fork of the US establishment, just as the\nUS itself was a fork of the British Empire. It\u2019s the same root, di\ufb00erent branches.\nThe ambitious intellectual who would in a previous life have become an academic\ntheorist, jurist, or journalist is now a founder, engineer, or investor.Because\nthere\u2019s a common thread between media and tech, which is the handling and\npresentation of information. Computer science took it one step further: it col-\nlapsed the distinction between the word and the deed, and turned a generation\nof intellectuals into software CEOs. Many people who previously thought they\u2019d\njust advocate for a law to be passed and not worry about the details found out\nhow hard it was to build things, to manage people, to turn a pro\ufb01t, to be the\none in the arena. They became people of the Network. And then they came into\ncon\ufb02ict with those who remained people of the State.\nAll of these are factors. But the last one probably gets to the root of the issue, because\nfundamentally, tech-vs-media is a clash of Leviathans.2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 77\nAfter all, the immigrant technologist moves betweencountries while keeping their tech-\nnical skills and network connections. For them, the Network provides their primary\ncommunity, while the State is secondary. Conversely, the American establishmentarian\ngains their power from the State. It is all about passing a law or in\ufb02uencing a pol-\nicymaker. And if the Network interferes with this process, perhaps by giving people\naccess to information that undermines the State? Then so much for the Network.\nTech-vs-media is then best understood as a collision of fundamental values, between\nthe people of the Network and the people of the State.\nThe Con\ufb02ict: Technological Progressives vs Technological Conservatives\nYou can think of the \u201cpeople of the Network\u201d as technological progressives, and the\n\u201cpeople of the State\u201d as political progressives (charitably) or technological conservatives\n(perhaps more realistically).\nBothareseeminglyalignedatahighlevelonthegoalofsolvingproblemslikecontrolling\nCOVID-19, building housing, or reducing car crashes. But the people of the Network\nusually start by writing code and thinking about individual volition, whereas for the\npeople of the State the \ufb01rst recourse is passing laws and collective coercion.\nPut another way, the people of the Network start by thinking about getting a piece\nof the network to call their own. A domain name, something they can build up from\nscratch, starting with a bare website like reddit.com and ending up with a massive\nonline destination that everyone voluntarily seeks out. The primary goal of the tech-\nnological progressive, the tech founder is to build \u2014 and for no one to have power over\nthem.\nBy contrast the people of the State start by thinking about capturing a piece of the\nstate. To win an election, to in\ufb02uence legislation via a nonpro\ufb01t, to write an article\nthat has \u201cimpact\u201d in the sense of impacting policy, to be appointed Undersecretary of\nsomething or other...this is their mindset. The goal is to get a piece of this gigantic\nbaton that is the government, to get a club to coerce people (for their own good of\ncourse), to maybe get a little budget along the way, and to \ufb01nally \u201cchange the world\u201d\nby changing the policy. To make something that was previously discretionary either\nmandatory or forbidden, to redirect the \ufb02ow of printed money, to exert force through\nthe law. The primary goal of the political progressive is thus the opposite of the\ntechnological progressive: their goal, verbalized or not, conscious or not, is to exert\npower over others.\nNow, this is a caricature. Of course there are good people of the State, just like there\nare bad people of the Network. It is possible to use a minimal amount of coercion for\ngood against genuinely bad actors; this truth is the di\ufb00erence between minarchism and\nanarchism.\nBut obviously, these worldviews collide. One group wants no one to have power over\nthem, while the other seeks to exert power over others.78 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nAs a possible future scenario, one way this could be resolved is if the people of the\nState use the law to smash American tech over the 2020s, thereby gaining more power\ndomestically. But tech has already gone global thanks to remote work, and most\ntechnologists are immigrants already...so the people of the Network may simply shift\ntheir attention overseas \u2014 or not come in the \ufb01rst place. So the federal action would\nmerely drives away immigrant founders, and the American State would lose power on\na global scale. (Local and state governments in the US may respond di\ufb00erently, which\nis an intriguing twist).\nThe same thing is also happening in China, by the way, where many of the most able\ntechnologists are now alighting for new countries \u2014 and no longer coming to the US,\nwhere they aren\u2019t welcome anyway.\nThe Enormous State, not the Entrepreneurial State\nAs a bit of a sidebar, a frequent argument that American people of the State make is\nthatthepeopleoftheNetworkowetheirvery existence totheState. Afterall, wasitnot\ntheir god, the US government, that funded the internet? Do we not need public monies\nto back basic research? And shouldn\u2019t the people of the Network therefore dutifully\nbow their heads and submit, joyfully paying ever more in tribute to the sacred Uncle\nSam?\nThere are a few responses to this. One is that the antecedent of the people of the\nNetwork were the pre-internet industrialists, who certainly were not well treated by\nthe State in the early 1900s. Another is that while the UK similarly gave rise to the\nUS insomesense, Americans do not genu\ufb02ect in the direction of the British Isles \ufb01ve\ntimes per day.\nBut the deepest response starts by acknowledging a kernel of truth: there wasa period\nfrom roughly 1933-1970 when the centralized US government did the Hoover Dam, the\nManhattan Project, and Apollo. The transistor and early internet came out of this era\nas well. And there were some later innovations also catalyzed by the State (albeit often\nby non-bureaucrats who managed to commandeer bureaucrat funds) like the Human\nGenome Project and the self-driving car.\nHowever, both before andafter this period, the centralized State was not the locus", "num_tokens": 1983}, "50": {"document": "of technical and scienti\ufb01c innovation. That should be obvious today for anything in\ndigitaltechnology; academiahasbeenraidedbytechcompaniesandventurecapitalists.\nBut it\u2019s also true for the period beforethe (well-intentioned) Vannevar Bush memo\nthat kicked o\ufb00 the government centralization of science. After all, most of physics \u2014\nfrom Newton to Maxwell to Einstein \u2014 was discovered before the National Science\nFoundation (NSF) was even created.\nThat said, let\u2019s talk about the 1933-1970 period itself. This period of \u201cpeak state\u201d\nwas real, but in overstated form it has become the basis for books like Mazzucato\u2019s\nEntrepreneurial State \u2014 which I disagree with, and which Mingardi and McCloskey\nhave rebutted at length in the Myth of the Entrepreneurial State .2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 79\nHere\u2019s why I disagree with the thesis of the Entrepreneurial State :\n\u2022The name itself is oxymoronic. As macroeconomists never tire of telling us,\ngovernments aren\u2019t households, because unlike actual entrepreneurs the state\ncan seize funds and print money. So there is no \ufb01nancial risk, and hence nothing\nof \u201centrepreneurship\u201d in the entrepreneurial state.\n\u2022The book doesn\u2019t consider the fact that most math/physics/etc was invented\nprior to the founding of NSF, and therefore doesn\u2019t need NSF to exist.\n\u2022It further doesn\u2019t acknowledge that it was possibleto do science and technology\nbefore the massive centralized state, through the distributed model of the \u201cgen-\ntleman scientist,\u201d and that this model is returning in the form of open source and\n(now) decentralized science.\n\u2022It doesn\u2019t take into account the waxing and waning of centralized state capacity\ndue to technology.\n\u2022It doesn\u2019t contend with the state-caused slowdown in physical world innovation\nthat happened during the post-1970 period, which Thiel, Cowen, and J Storrs\nHall have all documented.\n\u2022It doesn\u2019t look at how di\ufb03cult VC or angel investing actually is, so it doesn\u2019t\nreally ask whether those \u201cinvestments\u201d by the state had real returns.\n\u2022Most importantly, it doesn\u2019t engage with the counterfactual of what would hap-\npen if we had many independent funding sources, rather than a single centralized\nstate.\nSo, it\u2019s true that there was a period mid-century where all other actors besides the US\nand USSR were squashed down and centralized states dominated innovation. But it\u2019s\nnot because they were necessarily better at innovating , it\u2019s because they were better at\ndominating , due to the centralized tech of that time. It was more about the Enormous\nState than the Entrepreneurial State. And that\u2019s why the technological progressives of\nthe Network don\u2019t re\ufb02exively genu\ufb02ect before the political progressives of the State.", "num_tokens": 692}, "51": {"document": "2.5.3 The Base-Rater as a Flat-Curver\nSomeone who worships an almighty God won\u2019t readily change their beliefs.

That\u2019s also what happened for the\n\u201csecular\u201d believers in communism when the Berlin Wall and then the Soviet Union\nfell.

HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nIndeed, that\u2019s why people wrote books like The God that Failed when they turned away\nfrom communism. A Leviathan had given up the ghost. Whether that Leviathan was\nGod itself or the State, it was a crushing collapse of faith. As per the book of the same\ntitle,Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More .\nThis o\ufb00ers a useful way of thinking about the blue and red statists alike, the left-\nauthoritarians and the secular nationalists we discussed earlier. The American State is\ntheir God replacement, and they truly can\u2019t envision a world without it. Whether they\nthink of it in terms of \u201cthe Constitution\u201d (the conservative framing) or \u201cour democracy\u201d\n(the progressive framing), the civic religion of the US istheir religion, especially when\nfaith in God has fallen o\ufb00 a cli\ufb00.\nSo, they may not be dispassionately rational when forecasting whether their God, the\nState, might fail. There are three ideas that are helpful here.\n\u2022The \ufb01rst idea is Flatland. The premise of Flatland is that it\u2019s a 2D plane,\nand entities within Flatland can\u2019t really understand 3D things. They encounter\nspheres as circles that start as points, expand to their maximum radus, and then\ncontract back down.\n\u2022The second idea is the premise that historical time is far longer than human time.\nWe live on a tiny piece of a grand historical curve, a trajectory that looks \ufb02at to\nus over months and years, because historical time (usually) moves slowly.\n\u2022The third idea is what Tyler Cowen diplomatically calls a \u201cbase-rater\u201d, the es-\ntablishment type who essentially thinks everything remains constant. This is the\nkind of person who\u2019ll sardonically remarks \u201cOh, this time is di\ufb00erent, huh?\u201d, not\nrealizing that (a) they\u2019re quoting that statement out of context, and (b) the ob-\nviously fallacious opposite of that saying is the assertion that \u201cthings will never\nchange.\u201d\nPut these ideas together and you start to get a mental model of the base-raters, the\nblue and red statists. They think everything will always stay the same, that it\u2019ll stick\nat a base rate.\nThe only cycles they\u2019re familiar with are short ones: the cycle of breath over a few\nseconds, the cycle of sleep over one day, and the cycle of seasons over one year. But\nthey aren\u2019t familiar with any cycle that extends beyond one human life, because they\nusually don\u2019t know much history beyond what the establishment has pointed them\ntowards.\nBecause they don\u2019t think about cycles, they don\u2019t think about curves. They live on a\nkind of Flatland, except rather than being \ufb02at as in the sense of two-dimensional, it\u2019s\n\ufb02at as in the sense of a curve with zero-derivative.

IF THE NEWS IS FAKE, IMAGINE HISTORY 83\n\u2022Remember when Kara Swisher reported that innocent high school student Nick\nSandmann had done something wrong for merely standing still in front of a man\nwho strode up to him pounding a drum?\n\u2022Remember when Kara Swisher\u2019s Recode also said COVID-19 was \u201ccontained,\u201d\nbefore it ended up killing more than a million Americans?\n\u2022Remember all the o\ufb03cial disinformation on COVID, how they called people\nracists for warning about it, and said that masks didn\u2019t work before they did?\n\u2022Remember when everyone switched sides on vaccines, and everything else related\nto COVID, as Michael Solana ably chronicled here?\n\u2022Remember when the US establishment published reports credulously predicting\nthat in\ufb02ation would be transitory?\n\u2022And remember when there was minimal mainstream coverage of the 2017 battle\nfor Mosul, the world\u2019s largest military operation since the invasion of Iraq in 2003,\nthe war that Obama was supposed to have ended?\nYou probably didn\u2019t remember that last one, mainly because there wasminimal cov-\nerage, but watch this and then ask why you\u2019ve never heard of it before.\nIn each of these cases, we have something predicted to go to zero that ends up at\nmillions, or a certainty that winds up a nullity, or a hot war featuring the US military\nand 482 suicide car bombings that somehow registered on the public consciousness as\nzero.\nIf the US establishment could erase Mosul from memory in the age of the internet,\nyou start to see how Putin\u2019s Russia could pretend the 2022 invasion of Ukraine was\njust a \u201cspecial operation.\u201d And you start to realize that it\u2019s not su\ufb03cient to simply\n\u201ctake the articles with a grain of salt\u201d, and discount them a bit. By listening to the\nestablishment, your perception of reality may be o\ufb00 by one million fold.\nPatterns of Information Distortion\nThere are a few common patterns here, ways in which the information supply chain\nhas been distorted.\nChannel distortion. That which favors the US establishment is magni\ufb01ed 100X, while\nthat which disfavors it is downranked 100X or silenced entirely, such that the net\ndistortion is 10,000X or more. We can think of this as analogous to channel distortion\nin signal processing. Media corporations aren\u2019t just censors, they\u2019re sensors- and\nself-interested ones. That is, they\u2019re ostensibly measuring the world, but they actually\nhave self-interested reasons for reporting that some numbers are low (like in\ufb02ation and\ncrime) and others are high (like whatever social ill they want to address). There are\nmany such channel distortions, including (a) absence of criticism of media owners, (b)\nA/B testing to promote literal hate speech for more clicks, (c) self-referential quoting\nto give the impression of impartiality, and so on.84 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nNarrative alignment. The way the establishment determines what to put on the front\npage out of millions of possible stories should remind you of the political power theory\nof history. It\u2019s only things that support the narrative: their favored state policies\nwill always succeed, their disfavored tech competitors will always fail, their errors are\nhonest mistakes, your errors are \ufb01ring o\ufb00enses, the opponents of the establishment are\nx-ists and traitors, free speech is the enemy, and so on. Quantitatively speaking, it\u2019d be\nrelatively straightforward to use word2vec or something more recent to literally score\nand rank stories for their narrative alignment.\nPower over truth. In these incidents, if you stop to count, you often realize that the\nreports were o\ufb00 not by say 50%, but by 1000X or more. Why do these \u201creporters\u201d still\nhave their jobs, then? Because their job wasn\u2019t to make money, but to make power.\nThat is, they weren\u2019t trying to predict the future correctly for the sake of making good\ninvestments, but to repeat the party line to keep people in line. They\u2019re like actors, in\nthat their role was to say (or write) the right thing at the right time, to manufacture\nyour consent, to misinform you about everything from weapons of mass destruction to\nthe probability of in\ufb02ation, and to then claim democratic legitimacy after people voted\non the basis of their o\ufb03cial misinformation.\nComparison to an aligned sensor. It\u2019s worth comparing the reports by these media\ncorporations to reports by an aligned sensor, one where there is no way for the sensor\nto \u201cwin\u201d at your expense by distorting the information it\u2019s giving to you. Your gas\ntank does not report that the gas is at 90% before suddenly dropping to 20%. Your\nbank account does not zoom up in order to fake you out and get you to buy something\nfrom the bank, and then silently down again, like an establishment journalist trying to\nmanipulate someone before an election. The metrics on your dashboard at work are\nnot typically falsi\ufb01ed by people to make them more sensational. In each of these cases,\nyou are receiving reports from either a dispassionate machine or an institution (like\nyour company) where you have economic alignment and no signi\ufb01cant principal/agent\nissues. By contrast, the media corporation can report false information to you and still\nmake money; it has a mind and wallet of its own, unlike the sensors you own.\nNetwork rescue. Note something else: the onlyreason you are hearing about these\nincidents, and the only reason the rebuttals to them ever came out in the \ufb01rst place, is\nthe Network. It is only because the State\u2019s \ufb01ltering of social media is not yet complete,\nthat their downranking of dissident voices not fully e\ufb03cient, that their late-breaking\nattempttoimposespeechandthoughtcontrolsonafreesocietynotfullyconsummated,\nthat (a) the initial refutations were even published and (b) that you are seeing some\nof them combined into one document.\nThis last point is worth hovering on. Why do we know about these distortions of the\npresent? It\u2019s again because of a collision of Leviathans, because the Network routed\ninformation around the State, giving people actualrather than ostensible freedom of\nspeech.2.6. IF THE NEWS IS FAKE, IMAGINE HISTORY 85\nThe Network Delivered Actual Freedom of Speech\nWe elaborate on this in the Fragmentation Thesis , but the Network is accelerating a\ngreat decentralization of Western society that began shortly after the peak centraliza-\ntion of about 1950.\nTowards the end of this process, in our current era, the US establishment got so fat\nand happy that it forgot how aggressive its predecessors had been in imposing speech\nand thought controls. Basically, the establishment didn\u2019t realize they\u2019d inherited a\nhighly regulated, centralized communications apparatus where the vast majority of", "num_tokens": 1992}, "54": {"document": "Americans had no practical freedom of speech unless they owned a media corporation\nor were employed by one.\nAs such, in the 1990s and 2000s, the American establishment could seem to eat its cake\nand have it too \u2014 enjoying the rhetorical windfall of claiming to have a free society,\nwhile in practice holding an enormous distribution advantage over the common man\n(\u201cnever argue with a man who buys ink by the barrel\u201d).\nNow, itwastrue that the US was more free than the USSR, but it is not true that\nthe US was more free than the Internet. As we discuss later, social media is Amer-\nicanglasnost and cryptocurrency is American perestroika . So as the internet scaled,\nand Americans actually got the rights to free speech and free markets that they were\nnominally promised, the establishment started to feel threatened.\nWhy? Because while speech only in\ufb02uences volitional behavior (like voting), volitional\nbehavior in turn in\ufb02uences coercive behavior (like legislating). So, if the US establish-\nment lost control over speech they would have lost control over everything.\nThe Establishment Launched the Counter-Decentralization\nThus began the great Counter-Decentralization in 2013, the techlash plus the Great\nAwokening, what Jack Bratich calls a \u201cwar of restoration\u201d by an establishment that\nhad been economically disrupted by the Network but that retained the capability to\nmorally denounce its enemies.\nThe threatened US establishment increased the volume of attacks on their rivals in\nboth senses of the term; the sheer quantity of attacks and the level of vitriol soared,\nas you can see from the charts. Their rivals were basically everyone \u2014 tech, Trump,\nChina, Russia, Israel, Brazil, Hungary, Brexiteers, Macron \u2014 everyone that wasn\u2019t a\nloyal part of the US establishment\u2019s social network.\nAnd from 2013-2020, against all odds, this multifront campaign seemed to be working.\nAmerica\u2019s establishment spent down huge amounts of reputation, but they managed to\nwokify Google, Amazon, Apple, and the major tech companies, deplatform Trump and\nget him out of o\ufb03ce, and terrorize the country with massive riots. They completely\nreversed coursefrom the Obama era, silently stole the China issue from Trump,86 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nand polarized relations with Russia. They canceled, deplatformed, demonized, and\ndominated for the better part of a decade.\nThen, suddenly, after February 2021, there was a distinct slackening of support, of\nintensity. The coalition that had predated Trump, that had arguably caused Trump,\ndidn\u2019t seem to outlive Trump. At the time of writing, it\u2019s hard to tell whether this is\na momentary shift or a permanent one, but social engagement is down. People have\ntuned out. The US establishment is only talking to their hardcore supporters now. All\nthe other social networks they\u2019ve attacked \u2014 essentially everyone in the world who\nisn\u2019t a true blue American State-worshipper \u2014 they aren\u2019t listening anymore.\nInstead, they\u2019re reassessing their relationship with the US establishment, and with the\nUS itself.", "num_tokens": 711}, "55": {"document": "2.6.2 Distortion of the Past\nThe distortion of America\u2019s present has led people to re-evaluate America\u2019s past.

Surprise: the real Hidden Figures were Nazis.\n\u2022Germany sent Vladimir Lenin into Russia, potentially as part of a strategy to\ndestabilize their then-rival in war. Antony Sutton\u2019s books document how some\nWall Street bankers apparently funded the Russian Revolution (and how other\nWall Street bankers funded the Nazis years later). Leon Trotsky spent time in\nNew York prior to the revolution, and propagandistic reporting from Americans\nlike John Reed aided Lenin and Trotsky in their revolution.

And once it\nwent unthought, it was no longer even thought about as a potential threat. Moreover,\nthe original people who\u2019d consciously suppressed that obvious-but-threatening truth\nhad passed away.\nSo these unthought ideas were then sitting there waiting in a dusty tome, waiting\nfor someone to happen upon them, and accidentally rediscover them and put them\non the internet.

News\nfeeds that don\u2019t put American events by default on the frontpage. Supply chains and\ndigital services that don\u2019t rely on an increasingly unpredictable and anarchic America.\nStories that decenter the US, in other words, but that still give the world hope.\nThat movie point is a disorienting one, isn\u2019t it? You might be tempted to say it\u2019s not\nimportant. But it\u2019s all-important. We don\u2019t tell \ufb01ctional stories about the Kazakhstani\nmilitary saving the world because it wouldn\u2019t be realistic. And after 2021, it isn\u2019t\nrealistic to make stories about the US establishment saving the world either.\nFor example, a movie like 2011\u2019s Contagion that depicts a competent CDC is now just\ntoo far away from reality to permit suspension of disbelief. So instead we get a movie\nlike 2021\u2019s Don\u2019t Look Up , which depicts a chaotic America that\u2019s still somehow the\ncenter of events, still the country which the world relies on, but whose internal chaos\ncauses it to fall short. The next movie in that imaginary trilogy will probably not\ncenter America. What could it center instead?94 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nUnfortunately, the default right now would be to center China. The Chinese are after\nall putting out blockbuster movies like Wolf Warrior 2 andBattle of Lake Changjin\nwheretheybeat the Americans, save the world, and end up as number one. They have\nthat civilizational con\ufb01dence. And these movies are not laughable like they would have\nbeen even a decade ago. China is a real contender for the crown, unlike Chad or Chile.\nSo that\u2019s the set of stories that is waiting in the wings.\nOne response is to deny this and double down on American nostalgia, rolling out Top\nGun: Maverick and electing people born in the 1940s forever. This is what the US\nestablishment is currently doing, hanging on for dear life to the postwar order, denying\nthat any change is underway \u2014 and thereby refusing to gracefully adapt.\nAnotherresponseistocomeupwithnewstoriesthatcenterneitherChinanorAmerica,\nbut that do center certain universal values - and that give a bridge between America\nand what comes next, as America itself was a bridge between the British Empire and\nthe post-WW2 world.\nWe give four concrete examples in this chapter. But to be clear, just because a story\ndecenters America doesn\u2019t mean it has to be punitive. That is, these stories don\u2019t\nhave to condemn the US, anymore than the postwar order of 1945-1991 put the UK\nin the dock, or the 1991-2021 order really beat up on the Soviets that much. Indeed,\na new story could well feature past aspects of the US in laudatory ways. The main\ncommonality is that we need new stories that no longer assume the US establishment\nwill continue to be at the center of the world, or else people will be psychologically\nunprepared for that eventuality.\nAnother way of thinking about it is that the right kind of new story turns constants\ninto variables. Just as Bitcoin turned the constant of the US dollar into a variable, we\nneed new stories that turn the constant of the US establishment into a variable. By\ndecentering the US establishment in our mental models, we enable decentralization.\nWe envision a world where the US may not be there for us, because it was not always\nthere in the past, and may not endure far into the future.\nHere are four such stories. The \ufb01rst is the tale of the fragmentation of the postwar\nconsensus. The second is a generalization of Fredrick Jackson Turner\u2019s frontier thesis.\nThe third recapitulates the Fourth Turning concept from Strauss and Howe, as well as\nTurchin and Dalio\u2019s work, all of which predict signi\ufb01cant con\ufb02ict to come in the West.\nThe fourth talks about how our future is our past, how the mid-20th century is like a\nfunhouse mirror moment, and how we are now seeing a bizarre phenomenon where we\nrepeat past events but get opposite outcomes.\nAll of them turn constants into variables, as they describe a pre-American era where\nthe US didn\u2019t yet exist, and thereby prepare us for a post-American period where the\nUS in its current form no longer exists.2.7.

We won\u2019t\nrecapitulate the whole thing here, but in short the thesis is that after many genera-\ntions in which technology favored centralization (railroads, telegraph, radio, television,\nmovies, mass production) since about 1950 it is now favoring decentralization (transis-\ntor, personal computer, internet, remote work, smartphone, cryptocurrency).\nSo by this measure, peak centralization was about 1950, when there was one\ntelephone company (AT&T), two superpowers (US/USSR), and three TV stations\n(ABC/CBS/NBC). Even though the 1950s are romanticized in the US, and there were\ncertainly good things about the era, that level of centralization was not natural. This\nwas an enormous degree of cultural homogenization, conformity, and sameness relative\nto the pre-1914 world just a few decades prior. Many aspects of individual initiative,\ncreativity, and freedom had been dulled down or eliminated in the standardization\nprocess.\nRead William H. Whyte\u2019s The Organization Man or James Burnham\u2019s Managerial\nRevolution for a portrait of this midcentury time period. At the time, the mid-century\nUS was more corporatist than entrepreneurial. Yes, the system was capitalism, but\na highly managed and regulated sort of capitalism. It was all about joining the big\ncompany and working your way up, not founding one, except for the rare and just be-\nginning startup phenomenon on the West Coast, which was a million-fold less common\nthan it is now.\nEverything was signi\ufb01cantly to the economic left and social right of where it is today.\nYes, the USA wasn\u2019t communist, but it did have 90% top marginal tax rates, to stop\nany new people from getting rich and potentially threatening the system FDR built.\nSimilarly, the USSR was far more socially conservative than is commonly remembered,\ndoing things like taxing childless women to reduce their status if they didn\u2019t reproduce.\nTypically, those who complain about \ufb01lter bubbles are actually complaining that there\nis more than one.

At that time, it was\nunderstood that the free land of the frontier was crucial to the US in several ways - as96 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\na way for the ambitious to seek their fortunes, as a national aspiration in the form of\nManifest Destiny, as bare land for social experiments.\nToday, of course, the concept of the frontier and Manifest Destiny is not only not\nadmired, but has been pathologized since the 60s by the same deconstructionism that\nis one half of wokeness. You know the story: the American frontiersmen, like Columbus\nbefore them, were racists, colonialists, and imperalists.\nBut two points on this before we proceed.\nThe \ufb01rst is that there were Ntribes \ufb01ghting in the Americas before the arrival of the\nSpanish, the British, and the like. The Europeans simply represented tribes N+ 1,\nN+2, and so on. Had one of the Native American tribes developed a technological edge\noveranyoftheEuropeantribes, hadtheyinventedoceanicnavigation, theywouldlikely\nhave invaded Europe. We can infer this because (a) when the Mongols had a similar\ntechnological edge they did invade Europe and (b) many North American tribes were\nby contemporaneous accounts people accustomed to war. So, it\u2019s old-fashioned, but it\u2019s\nprobably healthier to think of the Native Americans more like the 300 Spartans than\nas helpless victims \u2014 brave warriors who fought valiantly but lost to superior forces.\nThe second is that if you read books like Reich\u2019s Who We Are and How We Got Here , it\nmakes clear that history is a boneyard. Contra the opening notes of Microsoft\u2019s recent\nIgnite conference, there\u2019s probably not a single ethnic group on the planet that simply\npeacefully occupied their plot of land since \u201ctime immemorial.\u201d One tribe\u2019s homeland\nwas once their distant ancestors\u2019 frontier.\nSo, with that as preface, let\u2019s generalize the frontier thesis. One way of thinking about\nit is that the frontier actually opened in 1492, well before the founding of the Americas.\nWhat\u2019s little known is that Columbus\u2019 voyage to the New World was in part driven\nby the Ottoman blockade of the Eastern Mediterranean; it was an attempt to \ufb01nd an\nalternative path to India around the Ottomans, but it ended up using technology to\nreopen the frontier in the face of political roadblocks.\nFrom 1492 to 1890, Europeans had what they considered a frontier. It started with\ntransatlantic navigation and the discovery of the New World, then proceeded to Euro-\npean colonialism, and from there to the independence of the US and Western expansion\nvia Manifest Destiny. Towards the end of this period, authors like Charles Nordho\ufb00\ninCommunistic Societies of the United States noted how important the frontier was,\nhow bad it would be if that avenue for ambitious men was closed o\ufb00, and how nasty\nthe Trade-Unionists were getting.\nHitherto, in the United States, our cheap and fertile lands have acted as\nan important safety-valve for the enterprise and discontent of our non-\ncapitalist population. Every hired workman knows that if he chooses to use\neconomy and industry in his calling, he may without great or insurmount-\nable di\ufb03culty establish himself in independence on the public lands; and,2.7. FRAGMENTATION, FRONTIER, FOURTH TURNING, FUTURE IS OUR PAST 97\nin fact, a large proportion of our most energetic and intelligent mechanics\ndo constantly seek these lands...\nI do not doubt that the eagerness of some of our wisest public men for\nthe acquisition of new territory has arisen from their conviction that this\nopening for the independence of laboring men was essential to the security\nof our future as a free and peaceful state...\nAny circumstance, as the exhaustion of these lands, which should materi-\nally impair this opportunity for independence, would be, I believe, a serious\ncalamity to our country; and the spirit of the Trades-Unions and Interna-\ntional Societies appears to me peculiarly mischievous and hateful, because\nthey seek to eliminate from the thoughts of their adherents the hope or\nexpectation of independence. The member of a Trades-Union is taught to\nregard himself, and to act toward society, as a hireling for life; and these\nsocieties are united, not as men seeking a way to exchange dependence for\nindependence, but as hirelings, determined to remain such, and only de-\nmanding better conditions of their masters. If it were possible to infuse\nwith this spirit all or the greater part of the non-capitalist class in the\nUnited States, this would, I believe, be one of the gravest calamities which\ncould befall us as a nation; for it would degrade the mass of our voters,\nand make free government here very di\ufb03cult, if it did not entirely change\nthe form of our government, and expose us to lasting disorders and attacks\nupon property.\nNordho\ufb00 was right. The aggression of the Trade-Unions eventually led to the commu-\nnist revolutions which killed tens of millions of people globally, led to \u201clasting disorders\nand attacks upon property\u201d, and generally became the bane of the world.\nWe can attribute some of this to the pause, to the closing of the frontier in 1890.\nThat closing took away paths for ambitious men, and ensured that they couldn\u2019t easily\nbecome founders on their own plot of land - they had to become union organizers, or\nrevolutionaries, or demagogues of some kind. Without the frontier, it all became zero\nsum. And thus we entered the steel cage match of the 20th century between fascism,\ncommunism, and democratic capitalism. There were some important frontier-related\ntechnological developments during this period in space shuttles (and cruise ships!), but\nthe frontier itself was not open.\nHumanity managed to survive through a bloody 20th century. After 1991, the frontier\nreopened as commerce on the internet was legalized. By the late 2010s, the combination\nof centralization and woki\ufb01cation (in the West) and Xi-i\ufb01cation (in China) threatened\nto close this frontier too, but BTC and web3 and the open metaverse have given the\ndigital frontier a new lease on life.\nToday, if we assess where we\u2019re at, there are four possibilities for the frontier: the land,\nthe internet, the sea, and space. Right now, there are 7.7B people on land, 3.2B on\nthe internet, about 2-3M on the high seas, and less than 10 currently in space.98 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nSo, practically speaking, an \u201cinternet frontier\u201d is easier than the other three. If we\u2019re\nlucky, we\u2019ll be able to use the concepts from the network state to reopen the physical\nfrontier, through a hybrid internet/land strategy, as described in this book.\nTo summarize, (a) the period of European greatness corresponded to the open frontier\nfrom 1492-1890, (b) the period of total war corresponded to the closing frontier from\n1890-1991 which ushered in a necessarily zero-sum world, (c) the peaceful reopening\nof the digital frontier could lead us again to a time of greatness, (d) the American and\nChinese establishments are trying to close that frontier and trap us into the same steel\ncage match of the 20th century, (e) but with su\ufb03ciently good technology we might be\nable to escape these political roadblocks and (f) reopen not just a digital frontier, but\na physical one: on remote pieces of land, on the sea, and eventually in space.

In other words, an important consequence of the fragmen-\ntation thesis is that our future may be more like our past. If peak centralization was\naround 1950, with one telephone company (AT&T) and two superpowers (US, USSR)\nand three television stations (ABC, CBS, NBC), we grow moredecentralized as we\nmove ineitherdirection from that point.\nEssentially, the invention of the transistor in 1947 is like a mirror moment.

Finally, the repetition of\neach event is often not exactly the same as the previous, but often a \u201cversion 3.0.\u201d For\nexample, Bitcoin is not simply the sameas gold, but a version 3.0 that combines some\naspects of gold and some aspects of digitized \ufb01at currencies.\nStill, there seems to be something going on. What\u2019s the unifying theory here?\nOne model, as just discussed in the Fragmentation Thesis, is that technology favored\ncentralization in the West and especially the US from arguably 1754-1947 ( Join, or Die2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 101\nin the French and Indian War, uni\ufb01ed national government post-Civil War, railroads,\ntelegraph, radio, television, movies, mass media in general, and mass production).\nAnd technology is now favoring decentralization from roughly 1950 to the present day\n(transistor, personal computer, internet, remote work, smartphone, cryptocurrency).\nSo, in the West, the grip of the centralized state has begun to slacken. The East is\na di\ufb00erent matter; after a century of communism, socialism, civil war, and Partition,\nChina and India are more internally uni\ufb01ed than they\u2019ve been in a long time.\nBefore we immediately jump to thinking that world is ending, though, we should note\nthat during the riseof Western centralized power people (understandably) complained\nabout centralized power and homogeneity, just as today during the fallof Western\ncentralized power they are complaining about fragmentation and lack of common voice.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve come full circle, exactly. As per the helical theory of history,\nwe might have progressed orregressed. But there may be an underlying cycle: \u201cthe\nempire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.\u201d\nAnyway, this model would explain why we\u2019re seeing an inversion: there was an upward\narc that favored the centralized State, but now we\u2019re in the middle of a downward arc\nthat favors the decentralized Network.So various historical events are recurring with\nthe opposite results, like the \ufb02uid \ufb02owing in reverse.

But morally revolutionary in the sense of inverting some\npremise that society at large thinks is good, yet that you can show \u2014 through your\nmeticulous study of history \u2014 is actually bad.That moral inversion is the moral\ninnovation that\u2019s the basis for a startup society, and it leads us ineluctably to left-vs-\nright.102 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY", "num_tokens": 253}, "64": {"document": "2.8.1 Why Discuss Left and Right at All?\nWait. Can\u2019twejustdotechnologywithoutpolitics,orusetechnologytoescapepolitics?\nUnfortunately, no, because politics is about people who disagree with you. If you\u2019re\nworking with computers, or robots, or pure math, you don\u2019t have politics. If you\u2019re\nin a highly aligned society, you don\u2019t have politics either. But to buildsuch a highly\naligned society from scratch, you need to think about politics.\nPut another way, if the startup founders of the 2000s and 2010s had to level up beyond\ntechnology to learn business, the startup society founders of the 2020s need to add\nhistory and politics to their curriculum. Because a theory of left and right is necessary\nfor nation formation.\nOur theory begins by discussing the split between visions of moral and technological\nprogress, the analogy between political and \ufb01nancial arbitrage, the market for revolu-\ntionaries of both the political activist and tech founder type, and the concept of startup\nsocieties as a way to reunify moral and technological progress.\nNext we discuss left and right as real constructs, using the spatial theory of voting to\nobviate the objection that left and right don\u2019t really exist, and qualifying our observa-\ntion by noting these are point-in-time constructs.\nSubsequently we discuss how left and right change over time, using examples from\nwhat we call the left, right, and libertarian cycles, in the context of both State-oriented\npolitical movements and more recent Network-centric tech startups.\nFinally, we discuss several speci\ufb01c \u201c\ufb02ippenings\u201d through history where winning teams\nchanged ideological orientation upon victory, and give a thesis on what the next \ufb02ip-\npening will look like.", "num_tokens": 399}, "65": {"document": "2.8.2 Reunifying Technological and Moral Progress\nBefore we get into left-vs-right, the concept of starting a new project with a moral\nrather than technological innovation will be unfamiliar to many tech founders. So let\u2019s\nmake it familiar.\nFirst, we need to understand the surprising similarities between startup founders and\npolitical activists, between those focused on technological innovation and those inter-\nested in moral good. The turn-of-the-century progressives thought of these as the same\nthing: progress was both technological and moral progress. Public sanitation, for ex-\nample, was both a technological innovation and a moral good (\u201ccleanliness was next to\ngodliness\u201d).\nMore recently, technological and moral innovators have grown to be at odds, because\nthe US establishment now regards its economic disruptors as enemies.As we\u2019ll get\nto, the idea of funding presidents of startup societies around the world could reunify\ntechnological and moral progress. But what exactly do we mean by \u201cmoral progress\u201d?2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 103\nMoral Progress is Moral Innovation is Moral Inversion\nIf you want to produce moral and not just technological progress, you\u2019re going to\nhave to introduce new moral premises that invert what people previously believed. So\none man\u2019s moral innovation is another man\u2019s moral inversion. Here are some speci\ufb01c\nexamples:\n\u2022smoking was acceptable, is now considered \u201cbad\u201d\n\u2022alcohol was \u201cbad\u201d during Prohibition, is now acceptable\n\u2022pro\ufb01t was \u201cbad\u201d under Communism, is now acceptable\n\u2022college was once considered merely acceptable, but in the postwar era became\n\u201cgood\u201d\nSome observations immediately come to mind.\n1. First, from this list, you should be able to generate many more examples (we\navoided the very obvious ones). And you might realize that a signi\ufb01cant fraction\nof today\u2019s public conversation is devoted to debating whether X is morally good\nor bad, usually without stating it quite so bluntly.\n2. Second, a moral innovation need not \ufb02ip something all the way from \u201cgood\u201d to\n\u201cbad\u201d. Simply \ufb02ipping it from \u201cbad\u201d to \u201cacceptable\u201d or \u201cacceptable\u201d to \u201cbad\u201d can\nbe highly consequential.\n3. Third, we can see that moral progress is not as straightforward as technological\nprogress. The moral step forward that Communism proposed - the premise that\n\u201cpro\ufb01t was bad\u201d - was actually a terrible innovation that led to tens of millions\ndead and a worse-o\ufb00 world. By contrast, the Enlightenment\u2019s moral innovations\nwere good, at least in the sense that they led to technological development.\n4. Fourth, that last point shows that benchmarking what \u201cmoral good\u201d means is\nnontrivial. Does it mean deontologically good, or consequentially good? That\nis, is this moral principle good in some abstract sense, or is it good because it\nproduces measurably good results?\n5. Fifth, if a given society has its moral foundations generally right, then most of\nthe proposed moral innovations or inversions will actually make people worse o\ufb00\nif imposed on the populace at large.\nAll of this is true. Nevertheless, a key realization for a tech founder should be that a\nsigni\ufb01cant fraction of people wantmoral progress. Just as much as the technologist\nwants to get to Mars, a large chunk of society wants to feel like the good guys \ufb01ghting\nin some grand cause. And if you don\u2019t give them that cause, they\u2019ll make one up,\nand/or start \ufb01ghting each other. (Note that Mars is itself a moral cause when framed\nin terms of \u201cbacking up humanity\u201d or \u201cexploring the \ufb01nal frontier\u201d.)104 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nAnother realization is that consent can bound the scope of moral innovation. The\ncommunistrevolutionsofthe20thcenturywereevilnotjustbecauseoftheirmurderous\nresults, but because they ran a giant human experiment on people against their will.\nThose who wanted to opt out, to exit, were stopped by Berlin Walls and Iron Curtains.\nBut the forgotten American \u201ccommunistic societies\u201d of the 1800s were generally good,\nbecause only those who wanted to be there remained. Anyone who didn\u2019t like it could\nleave. That\u2019swhythereopeningofthefrontierissoimportant: itgivesspacetomorally\ninnovate without a\ufb00ecting those who don\u2019t consent to the experiment.\nA third realization is that technological innovation drives moral innovation. While\nhuman nature may be roughly constant, technology is not. So new tech causes the\nintroduction of new moral principles, or the re-evaluation of old ones. Consider the\npremise that \u201cfreedom of speech is good\u201d: that means one thing in 1776, another\nthing during the era of highly centralized mass media, and yet another in an era when\neverything reduces to speech-like digital symbols transmitted over the internet.\nA related realization is that moral innovation drives technological innovation. Once it\nwas no longer considered morally \u201cevil\u201d to propose a heliocentric model, people could\ndevelop more accurate star charts, which in the fullness of time got us to oceanic\nnavigation, satellites, and space travel. Conversely, if you introduce the moral premise\nthat \u201cdigital centralization is bad\u201d, you move down the branch of the tech tree that\nbegins with Bitcoin.\nA \ufb01nal realization is that just like most attempts at technological innovation fail, most\nattempts at moral innovation will also fail. However, if those failures occur within the\nboundedcon\ufb01nesofaconsensualstartupsociety, they\u2019remoreacceptableasthepriceof\nmoral progress. And if you think society has in many ways now generally become bad,\nit may not that be that hard to \ufb01nd ways to improve on it through a moral inversion.\nPolitical Arbitrage and Financial Arbitrage\nA moral inversion is a form of political arbitrage. Nietzsche criticized it when Chris-\ntianity did it, but also had to admit it worked.Why did it work? One view is that\n\u201ca\ufb04ict the comfortable and comfort the a\ufb04icted\u201d is essentially the same concept as\nbuy low/sell high. You\u2019re supporting something when it\u2019s low and shorting it when it\u2019s\nhigh.\nThe mood of the words is very di\ufb00erent, of course. The political arbitrage of supporting\nthose with low status and attacking those with high status is typically framed as a\nmoral imperative, while the \ufb01nancial arbitrage of buying assets with low value and2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 105\nsellingassetsofhighvalueisusuallyportrayedasadispassionatemechanismforgaining\n\ufb01nancialcapital. Butrecallthatpeople dosometimesmakemoralargumentsforbuying\nlow and selling high (\u201cit helps markets become more e\ufb03cient\u201d). So you might invert\nthe mood of the words on the other side too, and think of \u201ca\ufb04icting the comfortable\nand comforting the a\ufb04icted\u201d as a dispassionate mechanism for gaining political capital .\nThere\u2019s a related observation: the concept of \u201cbuy low, sell high\u201d assumes there are\nmany di\ufb00erent assets to choose from, many axes to arbitrage. By contrast, the concept\nof \u201ca\ufb04ict the comfortable and comfort the a\ufb04icted\u201d tacitly assumes only oneaxis of\npowerful-vs-weak. However, multiple axes of power exist. For example, a man who\norganizes a million dollars for charity may be economically comfortable, yet can be\nsocially weak relative to the establishment journalist who decides to a\ufb04ict him for\nhis tweets. So the ability to designate just who exactly is \u201ccomfortable\u201d and who is\n\u201ca\ufb04icted\u201d isitselfaformofpower. Someonewhocanpickwhotolabelas\u201ccomfortable\u201d,\nwho can pick the axis of political arbitrage, can keep knocking down the \u201ccomfortable\u201d\nwhile themselves remaining very comfortable. And that means the concept of \u201ca\ufb04icting\nthe comfortable and comforting the a\ufb04icted\u201d can also be a mechanism for maintaining\npolitical capital .\nPutting these ideas together, once you start reclassifying much of the moral language\n\ufb02ying through the air as a kind of political arbitrage, you can start thinking about it\nmore rationally. Political arbitrage involves backing a faction that is politically weaker", "num_tokens": 1985}, "66": {"document": "today than it could or should be. An early backer that risks their own political capital\nto make a faction more justly powerful can also gain a slice of that power should it\nactually materialize.\nThink about the status that accrued to the Founding Fathers, to the early Bolshe-\nviks, to Mao\u2019s victorious communists, to the civil rights activists, or to the Eastern\nEuropean dissidents after the Soviets fell. These very di\ufb00erent groups of social revolu-\ntionaries all took signi\ufb01cant status risks \u2014 and gained signi\ufb01cant status rewards come\nthe revolution.\nThe Market for Revolutionaries\nOnce we see the mapping between \ufb01nancial and political arbitrage, we realize there is\na market for revolutionaries.\nToday, therearetwokindsofrevolutionaries: technologicalandpolitical. Andthereare\ntwo kinds of backers of these revolutionaries: venture capitalists and philanthropists.\nThe backers seek out the founders, the ambitious leaders of new technology companies\nand new political movements. And that is the market for revolutionaries.\nEquipped with this framework, you can map the tech ecosystem to the political ecosys-\ntem. You can analogize tech founders to political activists, venture capitalists to polit-\nical philanthropists, tech trends to social movements, YC Startup School to the Oslo\nFreedom Forum, the High Growth Handbook toBeautiful Trouble , startups to NGOs,\nbig companies to government agencies, Crunchbase to CharityNavigator, and so on.106 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nJust as there is an entire ecosystem to source and back tech founders, there is an entire\necosystem to do so for political activists. It\u2019s less explicit in key respects, of course.\nThere aren\u2019t term sheets between political philanthropists and their young proteges,\nthere aren\u2019t \u201cexits\u201d to the tune of billions of dollars, and we don\u2019t usually see political\nactivists bragging about their funding in the same way that tech founders talk up\ntheir investors. Indeed, often the funding trail is intentionally obscured, to frustrate\nopposition research.\nBut the process of going from a revolutionary\u2019s bright idea to a small group with a bit\nof funding to a mass movement is similar to the journey of a tech startup. And the\nendgame can be even more ambitious; if the top tech founders end up running compa-\nnies like Google and Facebook, the top political activists end up running countries like\nMyanmar and Hungary.It\u2019s \u201cgoing public\u201d in a di\ufb00erent way.\nTake another look at the careers of political activists as varied as Aung San Suu Kyi,\nViktor Orban, Vaclav Havel, Hamid Karzai, Ahmad Chalabi, Joshua Wong, Liu Xi-\naobo, and the like. All of them \ufb01t this model. Western resources backed them to\ncome to power and build pro-Western governments in their region. That doesn\u2019t mean\nthese political founders always won (Wong and Xiaobo very much did not) or executed\nwell (Karzai and Chalabi did not), or even stayed West-aligned inde\ufb01nitely (Suu Kyi\nand Orban did not). But if you track each of their careers back, you\u2019ll see something\nlike this episode, when Soros was funding Orban and both were on the same side as\nrevolutionary forces against the Soviets. At that point in time, Soros was the philan-\nthropist and Orban his protege, much as a venture capitalist might back an ambitious\nyoung founder. That\u2019s a classic example of how backers seek leaders in the market for\nrevolutionaries.\nStartup Societies Reunify Technological and Moral Progress\nYou might \ufb01nd it surprising, or disquieting, to think about all these di\ufb00erent political\nrevolutions as being similar to VC-backed startups. But revolutions are di\ufb03cult to\nbootstrap, so there\u2019s often a great power sponsor. The French were crucial to the\nAmerican Revolution, for example.\nWhat\u2019s the relevance for us? Well, the startup society reuni\ufb01es the concepts of techno-\nlogical and political revolution, pulls together the two di\ufb00erent kinds of progress, and\npresents a new path to power. Because now both the tech founder and the political\nactivist can declare themselves presidents of a startup society.\nBackers can fund startup societies using the mechanisms of tech, out in the open, with2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 107\nexplicit contracts, and consent by all citizens. But they can also achieve the moral\ninnovation desired by the political revolutionaries. And if these startup societies are\nbuilt out on the frontier, whether digital or physical, then the moral innovations are\nno longer imposed top-down, but adopted bottom-up by the people who opt in. That\ngives a better way to achieve the goals of ambitious young political reformers.\nIn short, once we see that a tech founder builds a startup company to e\ufb00ect economic\nchange, and a political activist builds a social movement to e\ufb00ect moral change, we can\nsee how the startup societies we describe in this work combine aspects of both.", "num_tokens": 1153}, "67": {"document": "2.8.3 Two Ideologies\nThe Spatial Theory of Voting\nNow we turn to left and right.\nThe simplest approach is to talk about the left and right as if they are permanent\ncategories; you\u2019ll hear this when people talk about \u201cthe left\u201d and \u201cthe right\u201d as groups.\nThe second order approach is to contest this binary. People will (correctly!) note\nthat realignments happen, that the left/right dichotomization doesn\u2019t fully encode\npolitical behavior, that the masses aren\u2019t as ideologically consistent as the elites, that\nthe categories vary over time, and so on.\nThe third order approach is to acknowledge this complexity but invoke the spatial\ntheory of voting, which allows us to quantify matters. As reviewed in this PDF, the\nspatial theory of voting allows us to analyze everything from Congressional votes to\nSupreme Court decisions to newspaper editorials. When we do so, the \ufb01rst principal\ncomponent of political variation doesindeed correspond to the left/right spectrum.\nThe fourth order approach is to then note that this (real!) axis actually rotatesover\ntime. It\u2019s more about relative tribal positioning (voting with members of the same\npolitical tribe) than absolute ideological positioning (voting for a constant ideological\nposition). Revolutionary tactics eventually succeed in gaining power for one tribe, and\nruling class tactics eventually fail to defend power for another tribe, so the \u201cleft\u201d and\n\u201cright\u201d gradually switch over historical timescales even as the tribal names remain the\nsame.\nFights Create Factions\nTwo factions consistently arise because coalition-forming behavior is game-theoretically\noptimal. That is, when \ufb01ghting over any scarceresource, if one group teams up and\nthe other doesn\u2019t, the \ufb01rst group tends to win.\nThis is a fundamental reason why humans tend to consolidate into two factions that\n\ufb01ght each other over scarce resources till one wins. The winning team enjoys a brief108 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nhoneymoon, after which it usually then breaks up internally into left and right factions\nagain, and the battle begins anew. After the French Revolution, factions famously\narose. After World War 2, the once-allied US and USSR went to Cold War. And\nafter the end of the Cold War, the victorious US faction broke down into internal\nhyperpolarization. A strong leader might keep this from happening for a while, but the\nbreakdown of a victorious side into left and right factions is almost a law of societal\nphysics.\nLeft and Right as Temporary Tactics, Not Constant Classes\nThe names for the two tactics that arise in these battles may hail from the French\nRevolution\u2014 the left and the right \u2014 but they\u2019re almost like magnetic north and\nsouth, like yin and yang, seemingly encoded into our nature.\nThe left tactic is to delegitimize the existing order, argue it is unjust, and angle for\nredistributing the scarce resource (power, money, status, land), while the right tactic\nis to argue that the current order is fair, that the left is causing chaos, and that the\nensuing con\ufb02ict will destroy the scarce resource and not simply redistribute it.\nYou can think of circumstances where the right was correct, and those where the left\nwas. A key concept is that on a historical timescale, right and left are temporary tac-\ntics as opposed to de\ufb01ning characteristics of tribes. For example, Protestants originally\nused left tactics relative to the Catholic Church in the time of Martin Luther. Then,\nhundreds of years later, the American descendants of those revolutionaries - the Protes-\ntant establishment, the WASPs \u2013 used right tactics to defend its position as the ruling\nclass. As we discuss, many such \ufb02ippenings occur in history, where a given tribe uses\nleftist tactics in one historical period and its cultural descendants use rightist tactics\nin another.\nWhat\u2019s the guideline for when a tribe will use left or right tactics? The tribe that\u2019s\ndefending (the ruling class) uses right tactics, and the tribe that\u2019s attacking (the rev-\nolutionary class) uses left tactics. Because institutional defenders tend to win, each\nindividual member of a revolutionary class feels like they\u2019re losing. But because insti-\ntutional defenders have to constantly \ufb01ght swarms of revolutionaries to hold onto their\nposition, the ruling class also feels like it\u2019s on the back foot.\nWhile there are big victories where the tribe using right or left tactics manages to\nsweep the \ufb01eld of their enemies for a brief interval, a new tribe usually arises that is\nto their respective left or right, and the battle begins anew. Can we ever escape this\ncycle of con\ufb02ict over scarce resources?2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 109\nFrontiers Mitigate Factions\nThe key word there is scarce. Everything changes when the frontier opens up, when\nthere is a new realm of unoccupied space, where resources are suddenly less scarce.\nThere\u2019s less obligate wrangling, because an aggrieved faction can choose \ufb01ght or\ufb02ight,\nvoiceorexit. The would-be revolutionary doesn\u2019t necessarily have to use left tactics to\noverthrow the ruling class anymore, resulting in a right crackdown in response. They\ncan instead leave for the frontier if they don\u2019t like the current order, to show that their\nway is better, or alternatively fail as many startups do.\nThe frontier means the revolutionary is simultaneously less practically obstructed in\ntheir path to reform (because the ruling class can\u2019t stop them from leaving for the\nfrontier and taking unhappy citizens with them), but also more ethically constrained\n(because the revolutionary can\u2019t simply impose their desired reforms by \ufb01at, and must\ninstead gain express consent by having people opt into their jurisdiction).\nThese are, however, reasonable tradeo\ufb00s. So while the frontier is not a panacea, it is at\nleast a pressure valve. That\u2019s why reopening the frontier may be the most important\nmeta-political thing we can do to reduce political con\ufb02ict.\nTwo Ghosts, Di\ufb00erent Hosts\nWe\u2019ve talked about the left and right as tactics. You can also think of them as two\nghosts, with di\ufb00erent hosts. In any population, at any given time, one subpopulation\nwill be hosting the leftist ghost and the other will be animated by the rightist ghost.\nLeft and right in this sense are almost like spirits that \ufb02it from host to host, occupying\nthe minds of millions of people at the same time, coordinating groups against each\nother. And as you start looking at the history of religions or political movements, you\ncan start to see that each has a \u201cleft mode\u201d for revolutionary o\ufb00ense and a \u201cright mode\u201d\nfor ruling class defense.\nWhy then do people often discuss left and right as if they were permanent classes rather\nthan temporary tactics?\nOne answer comes from an analogy to tech startups. Just like a startup wants to\nmaintainthepretenseofbeing\u201crevolutionary\u201d foraslongaspossible,andabigcompany\nwants to maintain the pretense of being \u201cdominant\u201d for as long as possible, so too does\nit take a while for a revolutionary leftist to admit that they\u2019ve becoming ruling class, or\nfor a self-conceptualized member of the ruling class to admit they\u2019ve actually become\ndispossessed. Paradoxically, bothsuch admissions are demoralizing. Obviously, for the\nformer member of the ruling class to concede that they\u2019ve completely lost is a blow to\nmorale. But for the former revolutionary to recognize they\u2019ve won likewise takes the\nsails out of their movement, the moral justi\ufb01cation for their revolution.\nAnother reason is that the switching tends to happen gradually, over historical\ntimescales. So it\u2019s not unreasonable to talk about \u201cthe left\u201d or \u201cthe right\u201d in a given\nperiod. Today, though, we\u2019re in a realigning time where the switching is more visible.110 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nMy Left is Your Right\nNote that we take no position on whether left or right strategies are objectively \u201cgood.\u201d\nIn our model, these are just tactics used by warring tribes, by two di\ufb00erent social\nnetworks going at it. The revolutionary tribe uses left tactics and the ruling tribe uses\nright tactics. But if the tribe using leftist tactics starts winning, it starts using rightist\ntactics to defend its wins, and vice versa.\nAs an analogy, take a look at this GIF of two magnets. They repel each other into\nmirror positions. Think of this as an analogy for left and right: my left is your right.\nWhatever you adopt, I\u2019ll have to adopt the mirror tactic.", "num_tokens": 1990}, "68": {"document": "Americans saw this in fast-forward during COVID. First the Republicans were con-\ncerned about the virus, and the Democrats were calling people racists for paying atten-\ntion to it.

Then Trump \ufb02ipped again to supporting vac-\ncines, while Biden, Harris, and other Democrats said they wouldn\u2019t trust a rushed\nTrump vaccine. Then the vaccine came out (the same one developed under the Trump\nAdministration\u2019s Operation Warp Speed!) and many Democrats were suddenly all in\nfavor of mandating that which they once wanted to avoid, while many Republicans\nnow booed this as an intolerable infringement on liberty.\nYou can rationalize these twists and turns.

In such a period, the con\ufb02ict is\nmore obviously tribal (\u201cDemocrat-vs-Republican\u201d) than ideological (\u201cleft-vs-right\u201d).\nPutting it all together, we propose that (a) left and right are quanti\ufb01able phenomena\nwe can see via the spatial theory of voting, (b) the left/right axis is real but rotates\nwith time, (c) they\u2019re ancient and ineradicable concepts, arguably on par with yin/yang\nor magnetic north/south, (d) they\u2019re complementary tactics to gain access to scarce\nresources, (e) if one group uses a left tactic, the other is almost forced to adopt a\nright tactic in response, and vice versa, (f) the frontier reduces political left/right\nissues because it reduces con\ufb02ict over scarce resources, (g) we can think of left as\nrevolutionary tactics and right as ruling class tactics and (h) the tactics constantly\nswap hosts over historical timeframes.\nLet\u2019s now drill into that last point, perhaps the least obvious: namely the concept that\nleft and right change hosts over historical timeframes. Our study begins by introducing\nthe left, right, and libertarian cycles.2.8.

HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nIf we take the 1000-year view, this is the long cycle that starts with Christian revolu-\ntionaries tearing down the Western Roman Empire by 476 AD, gives eventual rise to\nthe ruling Catholic Church and Holy Roman Empire, and then (1000+ years later!)\nsees Martin Luther nail his Ninety-\ufb01ve Theses to the Church of Wittenberg in 1517\nAD as a new manifesto that spawns a whole new crop of Protestant revolutionaries.\nIs there any alternative to this cycle, to a ruling class gaining power at the end of the\nrevolution? Well, if a revolution doesn\u2019t result in somekind of order, it looks more\nlike a Pol Pot or Seven Kill Stele scenario, where the \u201crevolution\u201d is kept up through\nendless killing. Something like that may be how past civilizations collapsed.\nThus,somekind of order after the revolution is preferable. That brings us back to the\nleft/right titrations: Christian King, Protestant Establishment, Republican Conserva-\ntive, Soviet Nationalist, CCP Entrepreneur, Woke Capital. Each of them justi\ufb01es the\nnew ruling class, the new order, with the language of the revolutionary class.\nNote also that not every one of these titrations has exactly equal fractions of revolution\nand institution. But the model happens repeatedly through history. A successful\nrevolutionary class becomes the institutional class, then a realignment happens, and\nthe new institutional class encounters a new revolutionary class.\nThe Right Cycle\nThe right cycle is the story of this epistle: strong men create good times, good times\ncreate weak men, weak men create hard times, and hard times create strong men.\nHere\u2019s the visual:2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 113\nThiscyclestartsfromtherightandbecomesleft. Ifweturnedthisintoastory, it\u2019dstart\nwith the rise of a small group of highly aligned Spartans. They grow on the borders\nof empire, so-called \u201cmarcher lords\u201d with a strong sense of ingroup spirit, what Ibn\nKhaldun would call asabiyyah . Then they radiate out and start conquering the world.\nTheir indomitable will carves a swath through the degenerate empire that surrounds\nthem. They eventually achieve total victory. Strong men create good times.\nBut as they scale, they can no longer do everything on trust and need to start imple-\nmenting processes and taxes. They also start attracting lazy parasites to the wealth\nthey\u2019ve created, people who want to join something great rather than build something\ngreat. And they have within their walls many of the people they just conquered, who\ndon\u2019t share their values and indeed didn\u2019t much like being conquered. No one wants to\nwork as hard or be as ruthless as that early Spartan band, given the easy wealth now\navailable, so they enjoy themselves and busy themselves by \ufb01ghting with each other\nover tri\ufb02es. So good times create weak men.\nEventually this bureaucratic, disaligned, decadent empire falls to a new band of Spar-\ntans from the outside. And thus do weak men create hard times, and in turn fall to\nstrong men.\nThe Libertarian Cycle\nThe libertarian cycle is the story of how a libertarian founder rebuilds the state.\nFirst, alibertarian(ish)founderleavesthesti\ufb02ingbureaucracyofabigcompanytostart\ntheir own. Most immediately fail, but through pure maneuver warfare and relentless\nexecution, that founder might be able to make enough money to hire someone. In the\nearly days the most important quantity is the burn rate. Every single person must be\nindispensable.\nEventually, if successful, the company starts building up some structure. Conserva-\ntivism takes over. With the business growing consistently, the founder adds structure,114 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\ncareer tracks, and a stable hierarchy. Now the most important quantity becomes the\nbus number, the number of people who can get hit by a bus such that the company is\nstill functional. Suddenly every single person must now be dispensable .\nThis is like the transition from unicellularity to multicellularity. The founder has to\ninvest in a bureaucracy that impersonalizes the company and turns every employee into\nan interchangeable part. Otherwise, one person could quit and crash the company.\nAround this time, the parasites start entering. They don\u2019t want the risk of a small\nor even mezzanine-size business. They want lots of perks, high salaries, low workload,\nand the minimum work for the maximum return. They aren\u2019t truly equity-aligned;\nthe company is just a job that pays the rent. The interchangeability actually attracts\nthem! Theyknowtheydon\u2019tneedtopulltheirweight,thattheyaren\u2019tthataccountable\nindividually for the business\u2019 success or failure. The system will support them. This\nbehavior is rational for them, but it degenerates into entitlement, and eventually causes\ncollapse of the company\u2019s business model, though this may take a very long time.\nFinally, some sti\ufb02ed employee decides to exit the stultifying bureaucracy and become a\nlibertarian(ish) founder, and the cycle starts anew. As per the helical theory of history,\nall progress is on the z-axis: they build the company, scale a bureaucracy to assist with\nthat, see it take over, and incentivize the best to exit. Thus does the libertarian founder\nrebuild the state.\nThe Uni\ufb01ed Cycle\nWe can synthesize these into a uni\ufb01ed theory of cycles.\n\u2022The left cycle starts with a group of revolutionary leftists that then become\ninstitutional rightists.\n\u2022The right cycle starts with a group of determined rightists that then become\ndecadent leftists.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 115\n\u2022The libertarian cycle starts with a group of ideological libertarians that end up\nbuilding a bureaucratic state.\nIfyouputthemtogether,yougetrevolutionary,determined,ideologues(aleft/right/libertarian\nfusion) whose glorious victory ends in institutional, bureaucratic, decadence (a di\ufb00erent\nkind of left/right/libertarian fusion!)\nMost people haven\u2019t studied enough history to have an intuition for cyclicity on a\n100-year or longer timescale. But many people arefamiliar with the lifecycle of suc-\ncessful tech startups, which exhibit this behavior on a 10-year timescale. That\u2019s about\nthe longest kind of experiment we can run repeatedly within a human lifetime. And\nfortunately the results have been widely witnessed.\nThat is, within our lives, we\u2019ve seen many examples of a startup disrupting an in-\ncumbentthrough scrappy tactics, becoming the incumbent themselves, and then\nemploying incumbent tactics to defend itself against a new wave of startups coming up\nagainst it.\nWe\u2019vealsoseen\ufb01rsthandthatasuccessfultechstartupistypicallyaleft/rightfusion. It\nhas the leftist aspects of missionary zeal, critique of the existing order, desire to change", "num_tokens": 1998}, "70": {"document": "things, informal dress and style, initially \ufb02at org chart, and revolutionary ambition.\nBut it also has the rightist aspects of hierarchy, leadership, capitalism, accountability,\nand contractual order. If you only have one without the other, you can\u2019t really build a\nmeaningful company. Right without left is at best Dunder Mi\ufb04in Paper Company;\nleft without right is an idealistic co-op that never ships a product.\nFinally, we\u2019ve also seen that just like most revolutions, most startups do fail. Failed\nstartups don\u2019t capture enough of the market for dollars, while the failed revolutions\ndon\u2019t capture enough of the political market for followers. But those startups that do\nsucceedthen need to \ufb01ght o\ufb00 both startups and even bigger companies, until and unless\nthey become a global goliath themselves (which is rare!).\nThe uni\ufb01ed theory is thus a centralization, decentralization, and recentralization cycle.\nTherevolutionary, determined, ideologuesbreakawayfromtheestablishment, andthen\n- if they succeed - build a giant centralized empire, which subsequently degenerates and\nspawns the next set of revolutionary, determined, ideologues.116 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nNew Boss: NotExactly The Same As The Old Boss\nThe concept we\u2019ve described here isn\u2019t Marxism, which doesn\u2019t have the concept of\ngroupsshifting sides from left to right and vice versa. The Marxist tacitly stipulates\nonly one transition, where the \u201cpoor\u201d beat the \u201crich\u201d and usher in the inevitable age\nof communism, and that\u2019s it. There isn\u2019t cyclicity in their theory of history. It\u2019s a\none-way ascent to utopia.\nThe uni\ufb01ed cycle theory is more similar to the plot of Animal Farm , where the \u201cnew\nboss is just like the old boss,\u201d Nietzsche\u2019s concept of master religions, the Lessons\nof History excerpt on systole/diastole, or Scott Alexander\u2019s \ufb01nite automata model.\nThese each tell a story of cyclicity; Orwell\u2019s book is focused on elite cyclicity (\u201cnew\nbosssameastheoldboss\u201d), Durant\u2019schaptertreatseconomiccyclicity, andAlexander\u2019s\npost discusses cultural cyclicity.\nBut the uni\ufb01ed cycle theory is not about a perfect circle at all \u2014 the new boss may2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 117\nbe much better or worse than the old boss, may not be exactlythe same. It\u2019s closest\nto the helical theory of history, because we don\u2019t necessarily come back to the same\nplace on the z-axis. Many of these revolutions may actually leave everyone worse o\ufb00,\nrepresenting setbacks on the z-axis, just like many startups fail. There is however the\noccasional crucial revolution \u2014 usually frontier-opening in some sense \u2014 that pushes\nhumanity forward on the z-axis and improves the world for the better.\nHoly War Wins Wars\nOne way of thinking about the uni\ufb01ed cycle theory is to fuse our theory of left as\nrevolutionary class tactics and right as ruling class tactics. A leader needs aspects of\nboth to win. The left gives the holy justi\ufb01cation to \ufb01ght the war, the right gives the\nmight to win the \ufb01ght, and together they allow that leader to prosecute a holy war.\nTo take two examples:\n\u2022Maowasacommunist, buthewasalsoabsolutelya\u201cstrongman\u201d createdby\u201chard\ntimes.\u201d He had that rightist ruthlessness about him, and unlike the stereotypical\nvegan paci\ufb01st of the libertarian left, his men were willing to impose capital pun-\nishment for any crime, real or imagined. Without some of that conventionally\nright-coded physical might he wouldn\u2019t have won against a Nationalist opposition\nthat was willing to use military force.\n\u2022Conversely, if you think of the Poles and Estonians revolting against the Soviet\nUnion in the 1980s, they weren\u2019t only making conventionally right-wing argu-\nments for capitalism and nationalism and traditional religion, they were also\nmaking left-wing arguments for democracy and free speech. Without some of\nthat conventionally left-coded humanism they wouldn\u2019t have won against a So-\nviet Union which claimed greater holiness.\nThe point is that in any holy war, the left is the word, and the right is the sword. It\u2019s\nthe priest and the warrior; you need both.\nThe left programs the minds. The priests and journalists, the academia and media,\nthey imbue the warriors with a sense of righteous purpose. They also justify the con\ufb02ict\ntothemanybystanders, convincingthemtoeithernotgetinvolved\u2014ortogetinvolved\non the warriors\u2019 side. In this concept of left, the priests transmit a revolutionary zeal\nthat justi\ufb01es the war against the opposing order, blesses it, consecrates it, says it is\nnecessary and virtuous, motivates the warriors, boosts their morale, and turns them\ninto missionaries that can defeat any mercenary.\nThe right furnishes the resources. They bring the warriors themselves, the farmers and\nthe miners, the engineers and the locomotives, the rugged physicality, the requisite\nhierarchy, the necessary frugality, the pro\ufb01t and the loss, the determination and the\norganization, the hard truths to keep a movement going that complement the moral118 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\npremises that get a movement started, the point of the spear that prosecutes that holy\nwar.\nWhy do you need both right and left to win? Unless it\u2019s a robot war (and we\u2019ll\nget to that later) you need high-morale \ufb01ghters, so you obviously need the rightist\ncomponent as we\u2019ve de\ufb01ned it. But the less obvious part is that you can\u2019t win without\nthe leftist component either, because mercenaries will run out of morale well before\nzealous missionaries.\nJust to linger on this, the right often underestimates anything that\u2019s non-physical.If\nthat describes you, don\u2019t think of what the left does as just words, as woke slogans or\nreligious mumbo-jumbo. Think of what they\u2019re doing as writing the social operating\nsystem, the software for society, the code that coordinates huge numbers of human\nbeings towards a common goal by telling them what is goodandbad, permissible and\nimpermissible, laudable and execrable. All logical deduction or martial action is then\ndownstream of these moral premises.\nTo summarize: you really do need both the word and the sword to win a war, both\nthe left and the right. And that concept applies outside the context of literal war, to\na variety of large-scale political movements, because (to invert Clausewitz) politics is\nwar by other means.\nAgain, this doesn\u2019t mean that every movement has a precise 50%/50% titration of left-\nand right-wing concepts, nor that there is some globally optimum combination of X%\nleft and Y% right that works across all time periods and societies, nor that the \u201ccenter\u201d\nalways wins. The main point is that a moribund left or right movement can often be\nenergized by infusing ideas from the other side.\nA group using right tactics often has a de\ufb01cit of zealous meaning, and is hanging onto\na ruling class position while forgetting why they need to justify it from scratch to\nskeptical onlookers. Conversely, a group using left tactics often has a lack of hard-\nnosed practicality, attacking the ruling class without a concrete plan for what to put\nin its place come the revolution. Forming a left/right fusion that\u2019s informed by these\nconcepts is quite di\ufb00erent from what we typically think of as a left/right hybrid, namely\npassive centrism.", "num_tokens": 1808}, "71": {"document": "2.8.5 Four Flippenings\nAs Saul Alinsky put it in Rules for Radicals : \u201cThe Prince was written by Machiavelli\nfor the Haves on how to hold power. Rules for Radicals is written for the Have-Nots on\nhow to take it away.\u201d One could imagine a third installation in that \ufb01ctional trilogy,\nand it\u2019d be about what happens when the Have-Nots win and become the Haves.\nWe call this a political \ufb02ippening, after the term from cryptocurrency. A \ufb02ippening is\nwhen the #1 suddenly becomes the #2, and vice versa. It occurs when a revolutionary2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 119\nclass \ufb02ips a ruling class, only to become a new ruling class. The former ruling class\nthen gets pushed into oblivion...or becomes a new revolutionary class.\nWe\u2019ll cover several \ufb02ippenings in this section: the left/right inversion of the white\nworking class, the American and global \ufb02ippenings of the last 100 years, a set of\nhistorical \ufb02ippenings that put these dynamics in broader context, and the ongoing\n\ufb02ippening between the ascending world and the descending class.\nThe Proletarian Flippening\nThe\ufb01rst\ufb02ippeningstoryisabouttheinversionoftheworkingclass. HowdidStakhanov\nbecome Archie Bunker? That is, how did the white working class \ufb02ip from the core of\nthe left to the core of the right in one hundred years?\nFirst: who\u2019s Stakhanov, anyway? He\u2019s the jacked Chad of socialist realism, the mythi-\ncal Soviet worker who all the men wanted to be and all the women wanted to be with,\nthe one who supposedly shoveled the coal of ten men in one day, the comrade who was\na real bro, the guy in the \u201cworker\u2019s paradise\u201d who somehow took no vacation time at\nall. Here\u2019s a pic of the (likely \ufb01ctional) Aleksei Grigorevich Stakhanov, from the 1930s.\nAnd who\u2019s Archie Bunker? Well, he\u2019s the bigoted patriarch of a once-popular 70s\nshow called All in the Family . Bunker\u2019s role was to get dunked on in every episode by\n\u201cMeathead,\u201d his enlightened, college-educated son-in-law. He\u2019s a foil for the TV show\u2019s\nwriters, representing all that is benighted and backward in the world. And here\u2019s a pic\nof the (de\ufb01nitely \ufb01ctional) Archie Bunker, from 1971.\nSo: these are two verydi\ufb00erent portrayals of the white working class, just a few decades\napart! How did they \ufb02ip? Why did they \ufb02ip?\nThe Working Class as Revolutionary Rationale\nIn the \ufb01rst half of the 20th century, the person all enlightened people claimed to care\nabout was the working man. The working man! Upton Sinclair\u2019s book was for him.\nOrwell and the Popular Front fought alongside Stalinists in the Spanish Civil War\nfor him. All the buckets of blood shed by Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin \u2014 all of that was\nostensibly for him. Hitler too claimed to be for the working man, the Aryan one of\ncourse; the full name of his faction was the National Socialist German Worker\u2019s Party.\nIn hearing both the communists and fascists tell it, the working man was the most\nhonorable, humble, put-upon, long-su\ufb00ering victim of a ruthless capitalist class...and\nalso the brave, muscular, tough backbone of the necessary revolution.\nThat\u2019s the context in which the Stakhanov posters (and their Nazi equivalents) went\nup everywhere.\nOf course, in practice, communism was slavery, because the workers had to surrender\n100% of their earnings to the state. As such, the Stakhanov posters were more cynical\nthananycapitalistbreakroominfographic. TheSovietworkercouldn\u2019tprotest,couldn\u2019t\nstrike, couldn\u2019t change jobs, couldn\u2019t really buy anything with his \u201csalary.\u201d And those120 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nwere the lucky ones! The unlucky ones were forced by Trotsky to dig the White Sea-\nBaltic Canal with their bare hands, or deported to Siberia by Stalin. As in Nazi\nGermany, arbeitdid notmacht frei .\nBut, bethatasitmay, communismhad traction. Atitspeakitcovered\u201c26%oftheland\nsurface of the globe.\u201d It was a secular ideology that commanded the zeal of a religious\nmovement \u2014 pure State-worship, in our terminology, the total replacement of G-o-d\nwith G-o-v. Decades after it had somewhat calmed down in the post-Stalinist USSR,\nit was in full murderous swing in the PRC and Cambodia. The political formula which\nput the working man on a pedestal as the put-upon victim of the powerful enabled one\nman after another to gain power worldwide \u2014 Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot,\nCastro, Kim Il-Sung \u2014 and then enslave the working man in the name of liberating\nhim.\nThe Working Class as Revolutionary Obstacle\nThensomethinginterestinghappened. TheUSmanagedtoavoidcommunistrevolution\n(barely \u2014 see Henry Wallace and Venona), scrape through the tumultuous 60s, and\nsplit enough of the proceeds with the union workers that they identi\ufb01ed with America\nrather than the \u201cgodless Russian commies.\u201d The physical manifestation of this was\nthe Hard Hat Riot in 1970, when American union workers beat up the \u201cdirty hippies\u201d\ncheering for North Vietnam.\nNow, suddenly, the heretofore ignored negative qualities of the working man were\nbrought to the fore. He was white, \ufb01rst of all. And racist, sexist, and homophobic.\nIgnorant, too. He needed to be educated by his betters. And thus All in the Family\nwith Archie Bunker began airing, depicting a very di\ufb00erent kind of working man. Not\nStakhanov, not the uber-Chad of socialist realism, not the star of \u201cboy meets tractor,\u201d\nbut an obese layabout that represented everything wrong with society \u2014 and who was\nnow the oppressor.\nAnd who was he oppressing? Well, the newproletariat: women, minorities, and LGBT.\nDemographicsthatdidn\u2019thavethatmuchpoliticalpowerwhencommunismwasroaring\nto dominance in the early and mid 1900s, but which gradually grew to represent >50%\nof the American electorate \u2014 a political prize waiting for anyone who \ufb01gured out how\nto tap into it. A political arbitrage opportunity, if you will, where the value of the\narbitrage was measured in power rather than money.\nAnd this is how the white working class moved from oppressed to oppressor. But one\nmore event had to happen: the fall of the Soviet Union.\nCommunism Was Centralized Left\nThe women/nonwhites/LGBT group of \u201cminorities\u201d (which >90% of the global popu-\nlation belongs to, if you stop to think about it) gradually became the core justi\ufb01cation\nfor the New Left, just as the working class had been the justi\ufb01cation for the Old Left.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 121\nBut there was a transitional period.\nFor many years, the Western left still had a foot in both camps, with Soviet sympathiz-\ners coexisting with New Leftists.After all, the hippies punched by union workers had\nbeen aligned with \u201cHanoi\u201d Jane Fonda, and were pro-Communist or at least anti-anti-\nCommunist. They were \u201cobjectively pro-Soviet\u201d using the terminology Orwell disliked.\nEven as late as the mid 1980s, a lion of the Western left like Ted Kennedy o\ufb00ered to\ndo a deal with the USSR if they supported him for the US presidency.\nThe Soviet Union wouldn\u2019t be around forever, though. For a variety of reasons, ranging\nfromthewarinAfghanistan, therejuvenationofAmericanmoraleanddefensespending\nunderReagan, thefreedommovementsinEasternEuropeandtheBaltics, andofcourse\nthe total failure of their own economy to produce consumer goods, the USSR was on\nits last legs. Gorbachev inadvertently doomed the empire in his attempt to reform it,\nby liberalizing speech along with economics at the same time. The double whammy\nof glasnost and perestroika destabilized a once tightly controlled system. Gorbachev", "num_tokens": 1983}, "72": {"document": "did do a bit of cracking down (the raid on the Vilnius Tower comes to mind), but\nfundamentally he wasn\u2019t as ruthless as Stalin, and a critical mass of his people wanted\ncapitalist consumer goods anyway. So, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and\nan attempted restorative coup by \u201chardliners\u201d in August 1991, the whole evil empire\ncollapsed by Christmas Day 1991.\nAt this point the Western left was at a crossroads. In China, 13 years earlier, Deng\nXiaoping had managed to outmaneuver Mao Zedong\u2019s chosen successors, throw the\nso-called Gang of Four in jail, and turn China towards the \u201ccapitalist road.\u201d Now, the\nother big communist champion, the Soviet Union, was going down for the count.\nIt appeared that the centralized left , the left with a designated and identi\ufb01able leader,\nthe centralized left of the USSR and PRC, of Stalin and Mao...that centralized left\nwould eventually lose its nerve and be beaten by the centralized right of the United\nStates.\nSo, after 1991, there was no more centralized left, no more communism, aside from\nholdouts like Cuba and North Korea that were of no global consequence. Instead it122 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nbecame all about the decentralized left, the fusion of the civil rights movement and\nFoucaltian deconstructionism, what we now call wokeness.\nWokeness is Decentralized Left\nIf you\u2019ll note, the wokes don\u2019t have a single leader like Stalin. They have no single book\nlikeThe Communist Manifesto . They don\u2019t even like to be named. This is notable for\na movement that is otherwise so interested in verbal prestidigation, in renaming things!\nRegardless of whether people call them \u201cpolitically correct\u201d or \u201cSJWs\u201d or \u201cwokes\u201d or\nwhat have you, they\u2019ll try to scratch o\ufb00 the label and say that they\u2019re just being \u201cgood\npeople.\u201d (You, of course, they have no problem calling you all kind of names.)\nYou can call them Democrats, and that\u2019s in the ballpark, but many wokes are more\nradical than Democratic party candidates (though still vote for them) and many rank-\nand-\ufb01le Democrats still aren\u2019t wokes.\nYou can also note that the boundaries of wokeness are \ufb02uid. Anyone can just start\nvoicing woke rhetoric. You may even sympathize with some of their stated ideas (as\nopposed to their actual practice). I do, in fact, at least with the motte version - who\u2019s\nagainst equal treatment under the law? Of course, it never stops there.\nYou can notice that they do have their symbols and hashtags and \ufb02ags (which, when\nhoisted, indicate control of territory as any \ufb02ag does) but that they often shy away\nfrom admitting that what they\u2019re doing is deeply political. It\u2019s again just being a \u201cgood\nperson.\u201d Then they return to writing policies and renaming streets.\nThey do have organizations, many NGOs and media outlets, of which Sulzberger\u2019s\nNYT is perhaps the most in\ufb02uential. But there\u2019s no single directing group, and there\u2019s\na very long tail of sympathizers.\nPut it all together: no single leader, book, name, or organization. So if the communists\nwerecentralized left, the wokes are decentralized left. If communists were like Catholics\nfolding into a single hierarchy, wokes are more like Protestants where anyone can set\nup a shingle as a preacher.\nCommunism was State-\ufb01rst, Wokeness is Network-\ufb01rst\nJust as an aside, there\u2019s a subtlety if we apply the lens of the Leviathans. While\nCommunists were centralized, they were not entirelypeople of the State. The reason is\nthat they had both the Soviet state and the international Comintern network of spies\nand revolutionaries. But they were primarily people of the State after 1917, as the\nglobal movement was downstream of the Soviet government.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 123\nWokes are the opposite. They are primarily people of the Network, as their habitat is\noutside the elected State. The control circuitry for the US government resides outside\nit, in media, academia, nonpro\ufb01ts, and the un\ufb01reable civil service.\nBut just as the communists don\u2019t control all states (though they wanted to), the wokes\ndo not control all networks (though they want to). Their major weakness is that they\ndonotyet have total control over the English internet, the Chinese internet, or the\nglobal crypto networks. But the wokes are trying manfully to gain such control. And\nthe switch from glorifying Stakhanov to denouncing Archie Bunker actually helps with\nthis, as social media users are much more helpful in gaining power over the Network\nthan factory workers.\nWhy? In the 20th century, the factory \ufb02oor was the scene of the action and communism\nwas all about the strike. This was a collective action that seemed to help workers,\nby redistributing wealth from the hated bosses. Over the medium term, of course,\nadversarial unionization actually harmed workers because (a) they had to pay union\ndues that gobbled up much of the pay raises, (b) they got a second set of managers in\nthe form of the union bosses, (c) their actions lead to a reduction in competitiveness of\ntheirstrike-riddenemployer,and(d)intheeventtheircountryactuallywentcommunist\nthey lost the ability to strike completely. Nevertheless, union organizing helped the\ncommunists gain in\ufb02uence over states. General strikes could bring entire countries to\na halt.\nIn the 21st century, the internet is the scene of the action and wokeness is all about the\ncancellation. There\u2019s no factory \ufb02oor, no formal union leader, no centralized direction\nfrom Moscow. Instead, anyone can decide at any time to use the rhetoric in the air to\nlead a campaign against their \u201coppressor\u201d in combination with others who subscribe to\none or more woke principles. It\u2019s open source, it\u2019s decentralized left.\nLike the strike, the cancellation is a collective action that seems to help the \u201cmarginal-\nized\u201d, by redistributing status from the hated oppressors to the cancellers. The likes,\nretweets, and followers get redistributed in real-time. Over the medium term, however,\ncancellation actually harms the \u201cmarginalized\u201d because (a) everyone can now cancel\neach other on some axis, making life highly unpleasant and (b) constant cancellation\nleads to a low-trust society. Nevertheless, cancellation helps wokes gain control of net-\nworks. Social media swarms in the 2010s could bring tech executives to their knees,\njust as general strikes in the 20th century could bring countries to a halt.\nFrom Working Class to Wokest Class\nSo, that\u2019s how Stakhanov became Archie Bunker. Once the US had integrated its\nworking class tightly enough to defuse its revolutionary potential, and centralized right\nbeat centralized left in the USSR and PRC, the left needed a new group it could use to\njustify its revolution. It found it in the \u201cmarginalized\u201d that it has now ridden to power124 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nas Woke Capital.From the working class, to the wokest class.\nThe American Flippening\nThe second \ufb02ippening is about the inversion of the Republican and Democrat parties\nover the last 155 years. As context, most Americans know vaguely that the Republican\nand Democrat parties \u201cswitched sides,\u201d that Republicans were on the left in 1865 and\non the right by 1965, but not exactly howthat happened.\nHowdidtheGOPmovefromthe\u201cRadicalRepublicans\u201d ofLincoln\u2019stime, totheconser-\nvativeRepublicansofmid-century, totheproletariantruckersofthepost-Trumpparty?\nAnd how did Democrats go from secessionist Confederates to anti-anti-communist lib-\nerals to woke capitalists?\nThe Short Version\nThe short version is that the Republicans gained moral authority after the Civil\nWar, used that to gain economic authority, then got critiqued by the (repositioned)\nDemocrats for being so rich, then lost moral authority, and consequently also lost eco-\nnomic authority, bringing us to the present day. The Democrats were on the opposite\nend of that cycle.\nThe 1865-2021 Cycle\nNow the longer version.\nLet\u2019s warp back to 1865. Immediately after the Civil War, the Republicans had total\nmoral authority \u2014 and total command of the country. During the process of Recon-", "num_tokens": 1992}, "73": {"document": "struction and what followed, they turned that moral authority into economic authority,\nand became rich by the late 1800s. After all, you wouldn\u2019t want to have a Confederate-\nsympathizing Democrat traitoras head of your railroad company, would you?\nGradually, the Democrats began repositioningfrom the party of the South to the\nparty of the poor. A major moment was William Jennings Bryan\u2019s \u201cCross of Gold\u201d\nspeech in 1896. Another huge move was FDR\u2019s re-election in 1936, when black voters\nshifted 50 points from Republican to Democrat, though they still voted Republican at2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 125\nthe municipal level.The wrap up was in 1965 when black voters moved another 10-15\npoints towards Democrats, though the civil rights era was really just the culmination\nof a multi-decadal trend.\nAfter 1965 the Democrats had complete moral authority. And over the next 50 years,\nfrom 1965-2015, the Democrats converted their moral authority into economic author-\nity. You wouldn\u2019t want a Republican bigotas CEO of your tech company, would you?\nNow that cycle has reached its zenith, and a critical mass of high income and status\npositions in the US are held by Democrats. Some stats and graphs will show the story.\nDemocrats have:\n\u202297% of journalists\u2019 political donations\n\u202298% of Twitter employees\u2019 political donations\n\u2022>91% of professors in the top US universities\n\u202226 out of 27 of the richest congressional districts\n\u2022>77% of political donations from Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google\nMeanwhile, the Republicans have by many measures become the party of the economic\nand cultural proletariat. There are of course exceptions like the Supreme Court and\nstate legislatures which are majority Republican, but see this chart from the Brookings\nInstitute, which shows that >70% of US GDP is now in Democrat counties. See also\nthis set of graphs from 2019, and that\u2019s beforethe money printing and small business\ndestruction that occurred during COVID. The dominance is even more total when one\nthinks about cultural institutions.What\u2019s the Republican Harvard \u2014 is it Bob Jones\nUniversity? What\u2019s the Republican Hollywood \u2014 some guys on 4chan making memes?\nSo, Democrats have become the party of the ruling class, of the establishment. And\nthe Republicans are repositioning as the party of the proles, of the revolutionary class.\nThis is why you see Democrats doing things like:\n\u2022tearing up over the Capitol six months after tearing down George Washington\n\u2022denouncing free speech\n\u2022setting up disinformation o\ufb03ces\n\u2022shifting from investigating the government to \u201cinvestigating\u201d the citizenry\n\u2022scripting the recruiting ads for the CIA and military\n\u2022putting Pride \ufb02ags on attack helicopters126 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\n\u2022advocating for corporations to \ufb01re people at will\n\u2022defending deplatforming as a private property right\n\u2022embracing the national security establishment\n\u2022allocating two billion dollars for the Capitol Police\n\u2022approving 40 billion dollars for war\nIt\u2019s like the quote from Dune: \u201cWhen I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom\nbecause that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, I take away\nyour freedom because that is according to my principles.\u201d Now that the Democrats are\nstrong, they are acting like rightists. And now that the Republicans are weak, you see\nthem acting like leftists:\n\u2022criticizing America\u2019s imperial in\ufb02uence in the world\n\u2022opposing war and military aid\n\u2022not trusting the FBI or the police\n\u2022expressing quali\ufb01ed sympathy for America\u2019s current rivals\n\u2022talking positively about unions\n\u2022introducing anti-discrimination laws to protect Republicans\n\u2022lobbying for free speech\nThis explains the weird \ufb02ip-\ufb02ops of American politics over the last few years. We\u2019re\nin a realigning time where many institutional things are \ufb02ipping from blue to red and\nback before \ufb01nally going bright blue or red. Free speech is now coded red, while the\nFBI is now blue. Because Democrats are the ruling class now.\nNote that this isn\u2019t an endorsement of either side, just an observation that two ultra-\nlong-timeframe sine and cosine waves have now shifted into the opposite relative phase.\nThe parties that many identify with and implicitly think of as constant were not con-\nstant. The radical Republicans attained socioeconomic power and their defense of this\norder made them conservative; the reactionary Democrats lost socioeconomic power\nand gradually repositioned as revolutionary. Now they\u2019re \ufb02ipping again.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean everything is \ufb02ipping, of course. Democrats are still pro-choice,\nRepublicans still pro-life. Republicans still have an institution or two, like the Supreme\nCourt and some states. Just as Democrats after the Civil War were very weak, but not\neradicated, and able to serve as spoilers.\nHowever, the two parties have \ufb02ipped on all the institutional bits, even if many Repub-\nlicans maintain the Monty-Python-like pretense that the conservative America of their\nyouth has just su\ufb00ered a \ufb02esh wound, and many Democrats maintain the Soviet-like\npretense that the ruling class is still a revolutionary party. Mexico has a great name for2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 127\nthis kind of thing, the PRI or \u201cinstitutional revolutionary party,\u201d but there\u2019s a more\nfamiliar metaphor: the startup.\nAs noted earlier, a successful startup wants to thinkit\u2019s still the scrappy underdog,\nbecause that\u2019s good for recruiting and morale. But now the Democrats are no longer a\nstartup. The party has completed a 155 year arc from the defeated faction in the Civil\nWar to America\u2019s ruling class.\nThere\u2019s a Ship of Theseus aspect to this, though. All the parts got swapped out, and\nthe parties switched sides, but somehow the triumphant Democrat coalition of 2021\nended up geographically and demographically similar to the Republican lineup of 1865:\nNortheastern-centric liberals arrayed against conservative Southerners in the name of\ndefending minorities.\nAnd if you go even further back in time, this mirrors the English Civil War of the 1640s.\nBrie\ufb02y, the people that came to Massachussets were the ideological descendants of the\nRoundheads, and the ones who settled Virginia 20 years later were the descendants\nof the Cavaliers, so it isn\u2019t a surprise that descendants of the same two tribes went\nto war about 200 years laterin the mid 1800s, or that their ideological descendants\nare gearing up for another con\ufb02ict right about now. See Scott Alexander\u2019s review of\nAlbion\u2019s Seed for the quick version.\nNot Everything Flipped\nYou could plot the geographical, demographic, and ideological coalitions of the two\nparties over the last 155 years. You\u2019d see a few di\ufb00erent staggered sine wave-like\nphenomena before they snap into the funhouse mirror image of 1865 that is 2021. But\nif we drill into the ideological aspects of the \ufb02ip we see some interesting things.\nAt the surface level, the symbols remain intact: Democrats and Republicans still use\nthe same logos, just like the Chinese Communist Party has kept the hammer and sickle\nmore than 40 years after Deng Xiaoping\u2019s capitalist revolution. On a policy level, as\nnoted, not everything has \ufb02ipped: Democrats remain pro-choice, Republicans remain\npro-life. But on an ideological level, that\u2019s worth a bit of discussion.\nCertain kinds of people are born revolutionaries. So when the Democrats \ufb02ipped over\nfrom revolutionary class to ruling class, when they shifted from (say) \u201cdefunding the\npolice\u201d to funding the Capitol Police, the born revolutionaries got o\ufb00 the bus. It\u2019s\nnot necessarily any one issue like the police, or military, or COVID restrictions, or\nregulations \u2013 the trigger is di\ufb00erent for each person \u2013 but the common theme is that the\nborn revolutionary just has a problem with what they perceive as irrational authority.128 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nVisualize the startup founder who just cannot adjust to a big company after an ac-\nquisition, or the writer who just refuses to hold back a story because of his editor\u2019s\npolitical demurrals. Born revolutionaries of this stripe include Glenn Greenwald, Matt\nTaibbi, Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, and many Substackers and tech founders. They just\ncan\u2019t bend to the establishment. But they also have real disagreements with each\nother, which is why they\u2019re independents, and why they can\u2019t mouth a party line. So\nthe born revolutionary is really far more anti-establishment, and hence today anti-", "num_tokens": 1986}, "74": {"document": "Democrat, than pro-Republican. Many of the most accomplished in tech and media\nsharethischaracteristic\u2013theydon\u2019twanttolistentoauthoritybecausetheythinkthey\nknow better, and in their case they often actually do. They\u2019re fundamentally insubor-\ndinate and disobedient, rule breakers and novelty seekers, ideological rather than tribal,\nfounders rather than followers \u2014 and thus sand in the gears of any establishment.\nOther kinds of people are ideologically predisposed in the opposite direction, to what\nsome might call \u201cimperialism\u201d and others could call \u201cnational greatness.\u201d As the Re-\npublicans fully \ufb02ipped over from ruling class to revolutionary class, and went from or-\nganizing the invasion of Iraq to disorganizedly invading the Capitol, the neocon types\nlike David Frum and Liz Cheney switched sides. In our tech analogy, these are the big\ncompany executives who only join a company once it has 1000+ people and leave out\nthe back when the writing is on the wall. They\u2019ll take less upside in return for less\ndownside, and are more focused on guaranteed salary and prestige. They\u2019re cyclical,\nas opposed to counter-cyclical like the revolutionaries. They follow the school-of-\ufb01sh\nstrategy, goingwiththecrowdatalltimes. Andinthiscontext, theiranimatingcharac-\nteristic is not so much that they\u2019re \u201cpro-Democrat\u201d but that they\u2019re anti-revolutionary.\nMuch of the national security state and military establishment is also like this; they are\nfundamentally rule-followers, institutional loyalists, and top-down in their thinking.\nSo that means that right now, immediately after the American realignment, we see\nall four types: (a) revolutionary class Democrats who still think of their party as the\nunderdog, (b) ruling class Republicans who similarly (as David Reaboi would put it)\n\u201cdon\u2019tknowwhattimeitis,\u201d (c)revolutionaryanti-establishmenttypeslikeGreenwald,\nand (d) ruling class anti-revolutionaries like Frum and Cheney.\nOver time, if history is any guide, the independent thinkers will move away from\nthe ruling class to the revolutionary class, while a much larger group of herd-minded\nfollowers will join the ruling class. Returning to our tech analogy, think about how\na few of the most independent-minded people have left Google, while many more risk-\naverse people have joined it. At Google, there isn\u2019t much of the early startup spirit left,\nbut there is a paycheck and stability.That\u2019s similar to the dynamic that characterizes\nthe Democrats in their formal role as America\u2019s ruling class: they largely control the\nestablishment, but they\u2019re losing the talent.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 129\nThe Second American Civil War?\nReturning to the previous section, is 2021 really just a repeat of 1865? Well, if history\nis running in reverse as per the Future-is-our-Past thesis, maybe not. Maybe 1861-1865\nhas yet to happen; maybe the Second American Civil War is yet to come. We discuss\nthis possibility later in our sci-\ufb01 scenario on American Anarchy .\nHowever, if we really push on the historical analogies, there\u2019s another factor that was\njust incipient during the 1860s but that dominated the era to follow. After North-vs-\nSouth slugged it out, America shifted its attention to the (Wild) West. Similarly, after\nwhatever Democrat-vs-Republican donnybrook might ensue, we may shift our focus to\ntech.\nBecause technology is a third faction. A group that was once identi\ufb01ed with the West\nCoast before the pandemic, but is now best thought of as decentralized network.\nAt least, about half of it can be thought of in this way. The technology companies\nstill physically headquartered in Silicon Valley would likely be heavily involved on\nthe US establishment side in any Second American Civil War, providing surveillance,\ndeplatforming, anddigitalenforcementfortherulingclass. Butthedecentralizedglobal\ntechnologists \u2014 those that are into the overlapping but quite di\ufb00erent movements that\nare BTC and web3 \u2014 would have a very di\ufb00erent attitude. They may not really\nbe \u201cpro-Republican\u201d, but they would be anti-ruling-class, and especially against the\nin\ufb02ation and censorship the ruling class would need to support its war machine. Any\ntruly global, decentralized platform would natively resist censorship requests by the\nUS establishment.\nThat may be the next step in the American Flippening: the con\ufb02ict between the\ndecentralized people of the Network and the centralized people of the State, between\nglobal technology and the American establishment.\nThe Global Flippening\nThe third \ufb02ippening is about the global reversal of the last 30 years, where the com-\nmunist countries became ethnonationalists and the capitalist countries became ethno-\nmasochists. In this \ufb02ippening, the countries on the economic left moved to the cultural\nright, and countries on the economic right moved to the cultural left. The ideologies\nreversed, but the geopolitical rivalries remained the same.130 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nThe visual above tells the story. The most right-wing country in the world is now\nCCP China, the ethnocentric champion of the Han, the place where \u201csissy men\u201d are\nnow banned from TV and whose self-admitted goal is irredentist reuni\ufb01cation. Its\ncore premise is ethnonationalism, which can be paraphrased as \u201cChinese people are the\nbest.\u201d\nConversely, Woke America is to America as Soviet Russia was to Russia. It is the\nmost left-wing country in the world, the place where whites go to the back of the line\nfor vaccinations and the self-admitted sponsor of global revolution. Its core premise is\nethnomasochism, which can be paraphrased as \u201cwhite people are the worst\u201d.\nAt this point, you may be sputtering in disbelief, in which case I refer you to these\ntwofootnotes to give a tissue for that sputtering. You may think this is obvious, in\nwhich case read this section only for entertainment. You may argue that the right and\nleft categories have no meaning; if so, go read the earlier section on the spatial theory of\nvoting and note that there\u2019s always a \ufb01rst principal component in any map of ideology\nspace. Or you just may be confused, contending that the US is still \u201cconservative\u201d and\nChina is still \u201ccommunist,\u201d and want proof of the switch.\nSo here\u2019s the detailed argument.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 131\nThe Global Axis in 1988 was Politico-Economic\nFirst, what was the political spectrum in 1988, right before the fall of the Berlin Wall?\nFrom right to left:\n\u2022USA: center right under Reagan\n\u2022Western Europe (NATO): center / center right\n\u2022Switzerland: neutral center\n\u2022PRC: migrating right, less ideological, hard to place under Deng Xiaoping\n\u2022India: left, socialist\n\u2022USSR, Warsaw Pact: far left\nI don\u2019t think any of these ideological positions should be too controversial. These\ncountries explicitly identi\ufb01ed themselves as conservative, socialist, or communist re-\nspectively. India was socialist, but not a member of the Warsaw Pact and not pointing\nguns at the West. China was nominally communist, but also not hostile to the West,\nand entering the second decade of the capitalist reforms begun by Deng in 1978. The\nUS was the champion of the capitalist right in spots like Chile and South Korea, and\nthe USSR was the global sponsor of the communist left in places such as Cuba and\nNorth Korea.\nThe Global Axis in 2022 is Ethno-Cultural\nBy 2022, what did the global political spectrum look like, right after the Russo-Ukraine\nwar?\n\u2022US Establishment: ethnomasochist far left, denoted by the Progress Flag\n\u2022Western Europe: center left, but with increasing variance\n\u2022BTC/web3: pseudonymous center\n\u2022India, Israel, Singapore, Visegrad: center right\n\u2022Republican America: nationalist right\n\u2022CCP China, Russia: ethnonationalist far right, the Z \ufb02ag and \u201cWe Will Always\nBe Here\u201d\nThe \ufb01rst thing we note is that the major axis has shifted. The primary axis is no longer\nthe politico-economic axis of capitalism-vs-communism, but the ethno-cultural axis of\nethnomasochism-vs-ethnonationalism. Is it the ultimate evil for a state to consciously\nrepresent its majority race (as America contends) or is it the ultimate good (as China", "num_tokens": 1988}, "75": {"document": "contends)? Or should it be neither, as the pseudonymous economy contends?\nThe second thing we see is that the middle has shifted. Switzerland is no longer\nneutral, as it\u2019s siding with the US now. Cryptocurrency and cryptography is now132 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nSwitzerland, what Obama called the \u201cSwiss bank account in your pocket.\u201d And \u2013 as\njust noted \u2013 it o\ufb00ers an ethical alternative to both American ethnomasochism and\nChinese ethnonationalism, namely pseudonymous meritocracy.\nThe third thing we note is that we don\u2019t use the American \ufb02ag to represent the US\nestablishment as it is very much a disputed symbol, with some in the establishment\nclaiming it while others claim it is disturbing. So instead, we use the Progress Flag\nfor the US establishment as (a) this is proudly raised by the State Department and in\nthe White House and (b) it sharply distinguishes the establishment from a Republican\nAmerica that very much does not\ufb02y the Progress Flag, but might instead \ufb02y the Thin\nBlue Line \ufb02ag or (eventually) the \ufb02ag of Bitcoin Maximalism.\nThe fourth thing (which is not on the \ufb01gure) is that we don\u2019t think of Republican\nAmerica as coincident with the US establishment anymore. That\u2019s because the US\nis abinational state with two warring ethnicities (Democrat and Republican) rather\nthan a single nation state. We didn\u2019t put a separate Republican \ufb02ag on the \ufb01gure,\nthough, as placing it on the nationalist right would seem to cluster it near China, and\nRepublicans dislike China as much as they dislike the Democrats. So you need to go\nto more dimensions than just a linear axis, which we discuss in the next chapter on\nNYT/CCP/BTC .\nThe \ufb01fth thing we note is that Europe is now broadly to the rightof the US Estab-\nlishment on ethno-cultural issues, whereas it was to the left of the US in 1988. (See\nMacron and Orban\u2019s comments, for example, if this isn\u2019t on your radar.)\nThe last and most important thing is that this is a rough inversion of the 20th century,\nas the formerly communist/socialist countries are on the ethnocultural right, while the\ncapitalist bloc is on the ethnocultural left.\nEvidence for the Global Political Spectrum of 2022\nHow can we establish that this ethnocultural axis is a reasonable one-dimensional\nrepresentation of reality? Let\u2019s do it in stages.\n1.Existence of an axis. First, the #1 and #2 powers of this era are the US and\nChina, establishing these as the poles of someaxis in the \ufb01rst place.\n\u2022Here\u2019s a graph of global GDP, showing the US and China as #1 and #2.\n\u2022Here\u2019s a graph of global military power, again #1 and #2.\n\u2022Here\u2019s Ian Bremmer\u2019s G-2 concept.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 133\n\u2022And here are several books and articles that talk about this include Destined\nfor War,The United States vs. China (FT review), and Getting China\nWrong.\n2.Unity of NYT, Harvard, and Democrats as the US Establishment. Next, let\u2019s\nestablish that there is alignment between America\u2019s informal government (NYT,\nHarvard, etc) and the formal government (elected Democrats and career bureau-\ncrats). Basically, we want to show that (a) this an interconnected social network\nand (b) it is on the ethnomasochist left.\n\u2022The Progress Flag was raised over the U.S. State Department and\n\u2022The Progress Flag is raised in the White House by the US Press Secretary\nand a Navy Admiral\n\u202297% of journalists\u2019 political donations went to Democrats\n\u202290.1% of Harvard students voted Democrat\n\u202298.82% of partisan contributions at Harvard\u2019s FAS went to Democrats\n\u202290% of professors at top universities are Democrat\n\u2022NYT\u2019s use of ethnomasochist words went exponential in the 2010s\n\u2022The graphs in Yglesias\u2019 article on the Great Awokening show that white\nDemocrats are to the cultural left of black Democrats on many issues\n3.NYT denunciation of entities to their right. Third, let\u2019s show that the US estab-\nlishment\u2019s leading paper, the New York Times, has run articles indicating that\nChina, Russia, India, Israel, Singapore, Hungary, and France are \u201cfascist\u201d and\n\u201cauthoritarian\u201d and hence to its right. We note that none of these countries are\nbeing denounced as \u201ccommunist\u201d or to NYT\u2019s left.\n\u2022China: \u201cCan China Be Described as \u2019Fascist\u2019?\u201d\n\u2022Russia: \u201cWe Should Say It. Russia Is Fascist.\u201d\n\u2022India: \u201cThe Rise of Modi: India\u2019s Rightward Turn\u201d\n\u2022Israel: \u201cIsraelis May Have Committed Crimes Against Humanity in Gaza\nProtests, U.N. Says\u201d\n\u2022Singapore: \u201cDavid Marshall, 87, Opponent Of Singapore Authoritarianism\u201d\n\u2022Hungary: \u201cHe Used to Call Viktor Orban an Ally. Now He Calls Him a\nSymbol of Fascism.\u201d\n\u2022France: \u201cFrance\u2019s Far Right Turn\u201d\n4.China and Russia are to the cultural right of the US. Next, let\u2019s establish that\nChina and Russia take culturally conservative positions on marriage and family\nthat put them substantially to the right of today\u2019s West.134 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\n\u2022Russia: see their actions in favor of \u201ctraditional families\u201d, and Richard Hana-\nnia\u2019s piece on Russia the \u201cGreat Satan in the Liberal Imagination\u201d.\n\u2022China: read about their ban on \u201csissy men\u201d and promotion of traditional\nmarriage and family.\n5.Europe is also to the cultural right of America. Now, let\u2019s show how European\ncountries have put out statements noting that they are actually alsoto the right\nof America on ethnocultural issues, albeit not as far from the US as China and\nRussia are.\n\u2022France on wokeness: Macron, France Reject American \u201cWoke\u201d Culture\nThat\u2019s \u201cRacializing\u201d Their Country\n\u2022Visegrad on immigration: Visegrad Four grouping push back on new EU\nmigration plan\n\u2022UK on immigration: The UK\u2019s \u201cAnti-Refugee Bill\u201d: What Everyone Should\nKnow\nSo if you put all those together, we have (a) the existence of a US/China axis, (b) a\ngroup of institutions that can be reasonably regarded as the voice of the US establish-\nment, (c) a set of NYT denunciations of other countries as being to the right of the US\nestablishment, (d) positions from China and Russia that are far to the ethnocultural\nright of the US establishment, and (e) a set of statements from European heads of state\nlike Macron and Orban indicating that the US establishment is also to their left.\nNote that even if you dispute the absolute position of any given country on this axis,\nit\u2019s now hard to argue with their relativeposition. That is, if you click the links above,\nyou\u2019ll see that NYT does think of Russia and China (and France, Hungary, India,\nIsrael, and so on) as all being to its right on ethnocultural matters. And Russia and\nChina do think of the US establishment as being to their left on the same things.\nI belabor this point because it\u2019s somewhat implicit. The capitalist-vs-communist di-\nvide of the 20th century was an o\ufb03cial, declared economic divide. By contrast, today\u2019s\nethnonationalist-vs-ethnomasochist divide is an uno\ufb03cial, undeclared cultural divide.\nIt is nevertheless the primary global axis of con\ufb02ict, and a very real reason for hos-\ntility between the Sino-Russians and the US Establishment.Even if the geopolitics\nhave remained similar, with the Chinese and Russians of Mackinder\u2019s world island still\naligned against the Anglo-Americans, the ideologies have \ufb02ipped.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 135\nThe Historical Flippenings\nOur fourth \ufb02ippening story is a survey of historical \ufb02ippenings. How did the revolu-\ntionary class become the ruling class, through history?\n\u2022From Christian crash to Christian kings.

It combines (a) the moral\nfervor of a political movement with (b) the laser-focus of a startup company into (c) a\none-commandment based startup society.2.9. THE ONE COMMANDMENT 141\nSuch a society is not a total revolution. We aren\u2019t starting completely de novo. Each\nstartup society is simply taking a broken aspect of today\u2019s world, often a State-caused\nor at least State-neglected calamity, writing the history of that state failure, and then\nbuilding an opt-in community to solve the problem.\nIt\u2019s a tightly focused parallel society making one impactful change.\nWhy Not More Than One Commandment?\nWhy is it so important to introduce onecommandment rather than zero or N?\nThe short answer is that you don\u2019t want to write something as complex as a social\noperating system from scratch, and in fact others will prevent you from doing so. But\nyou also don\u2019t want to avoid innovating on a broken society. So introducing one (1)\ntightly focused change at a time in a startup society with opt-in citizens allows testing\nof the new commandment.\nThe longer answer revolves around an important paradox of modern society: namely,\nthatmanypeoplefeeluncomfortableevangelizingreligiousmorals, yetverycomfortable\nevangelizing their political ethics.\nThe \ufb01rst part is easy to understand. Westerners are nowadays often shy about telling\nothers to practice their religion. Why? They may feel they haven\u2019t \ufb01gured it all out,\nso who are they to say? Or they know they can\u2019t live up to their ideal moral code,\nlike someone who wants to diet but can\u2019t always restrain themselves, so they refrain\nfrom commentary to avoid the charge of hypocrisy. They also may not want to be\nattacked as a crazy cult leader. All of these are understandable hesitations for either\n(a) evangelizing a traditional religion, (b) inventing a wholly new one, or (c) forking an\nexistingreligion. (Thelast iskindof like startinganew denominationofProtestantism,\nwhere you keep much of the old codebase but add in some crucial distinctive factors.)\nBut think about the second part. While there is great hesitation in Western society\naroundreligious evangelism, there is seemingly no hesitation around political evange-\nlism. Indeed, thisis considered an ethical duty, usually in exactly those terms, with\nthe word \u201cethical\u201d used in place of \u201cmoral\u201d but serving a very similar role, and with at\nleast two large competing political parties \ufb01ghting for the souls/votes of their believers.\nTherein lies the paradox: while political and religious movements can both be con-\nsidereddoctrines, in that they come packaged with a number of directives on how\npeoplemustlive, the same person who is shy about telling other people about morality\nis often incredibly con\ufb01dent when yelling at other people about politics.\nThat\u2019s why we advise one commandment for your new startup society. It\u2019s something\nin between being too shy and too overbearing. It\u2019s in between avoiding religious-\nsounding evangelism entirely and indulging in political-sounding evangelism too much.\nDon\u2019t avoid taking a moral stance, because that means you passively succumb to your142 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY\nsurroundings. But also don\u2019t try imposing an all-encompassing political ideology to\nstart, because that\u2019s too hard and means total warfare with your surroundings.\nInstead, just pick one\ufb02aw in modern society that you dofeel con\ufb01dent in building a\nstartup society to redress, and go with that.

What about older religions, political\ncodes, and moral commandments?\nYou can certainly return to an older known religious code, adopting it in whole or in\npart. In a startup society, where everyone opts in, you can make this happen more\neasily because religion in many countries is mostly about private practice: so long as\npeople agree in a peer-to-peer fashion to practice their religion a certain way, the state\nallows them to do it.\nIt\u2019s harder to return to an older political code, because you are now talking about\npublic law rather than private law.

Outsiders perceived the Soviets to be cynical, but they were wrong;\ntheir cynicism had limits. At the end of the day, the Soviets were devout believers in\ntheir ideology.\nHow could it be otherwise?

The censorship was so pervasive that it controlled thought. The degree\nof self-deception was so all-encompassing that even the nomenklatura like Boris Yeltsin\ndidn\u2019t know how truly poor the Soviet Union was till he visited an American supermar-\nket and threw up his hands at how far behind the USSR was. Unlike Orwell\u2019s O\u2019Brien,\nthe Soviet leaders deceived themselves too.\nSo, fundamentally, any proposed edits by Soviet elites to the USSR would have been\njust on the margins.

The parallel systems of the US and Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan\nwere maintained against the USSR and PRC at enormous cost by \ufb01ghting for large\ncontiguous regions of land. That was a very State-centric approach.\nIn the 21st century, our approach suggests a Network-centric way to build parallel\nsystems: create one opt-in society at a time, purely digitally if need be, justifying it\nwith a historical/moral critique of the present system that delegitimizes State violence\nagainst them and allows the experiment to continue.\nMany will fail, but for those that succeed, we can merge together the good changes and\ndiscard the bad ones, and eventually get a parallel society that di\ufb00ers in many respects\nfrom (say) the original US codebase, but that maintains enough similarity that it\u2019s\n\u201cbackwards compatible\u201d and citizens can migrate over.

Many historians believe the German military had, on\na pound-for-pound basis, the best equipment in the war. But because they lacked\nthe capitalist\u2019s ability to cooperate across borders, they drove away some of their best\nscientists prior to murdering others, ensuring they\u2019d never gain the atomic bomb. And\nbecause their morality amounted to Aryan supremacy, which didn\u2019t appeal to anyone\nother than their co-ethnics, they never managed to build a large enough global coalition\nto win - which is why the 70M Germans were eventually beaten by the 50M British,\nthe 150M Americans, and the 150M Soviets.\nAs for the mid-century Americans, their primary strategy was democratic capitalism,\nas opposed to Soviet communism or national socialism. They preached a morality,\nbut framed it in terms of a capitalist-friendly four freedoms; they built an arsenal of\ndemocracy, but it arose from their commercial industrial base. It is in this sense that\nWW2 America was a money power .\nAccompanying the money power was media power, just as capitalism went with democ-\nracy. The Americans were much better at media than the Nazis (who couldn\u2019t argue in\nEnglish) and incrementally better than the Soviets (whose propaganda was ultimately\nundermined by their lack of prosperity).

Its go-to tactics are moral badgering and mole-\ndriven espionage, just like the Soviet Union.\nOn the moral point, go back and look at any recent NYT headline and note how many\nof the articles involve a moralrather than factual premise as the core point. Free\nspeech is bad, white people are bad, communism was good...this is the kind of thing\nthey are focused on.And it is in this sense that NYT is a moral power.\nOn the espionage point, as just discussed, we know that the Soviets were past masters\nat subversion. Their moral convictions made them feel that invading the privacy of\nothers, stealing secrets, destroying lives with Zerzetsung\u2014 all of that was acceptable\nfor the great moral cause of communism. Because they weren\u2019t as good at building as\nthe US or even Germany (the Soviet munitions came from America via Lend-Lease),\nstealing/destroying was the best thing they could do.\nSulzberger\u2019s employees and American journalists in general are similar. They\u2019re the\nStasi with a stock symbol, the original surveillance capitalists. It\u2019s always phrased in\nthe passive voice, but how exactly did \u201cThe New York Times obtain\u201d the things they\nprint? The story behind the story is more interesting than the story, and the behind\nthe scenes footage would show you a di\ufb00erent movie than the one they want you to\nwatch.\nIn short, much like the communists, the journalists\u2019 moral conviction gives them the\nlicense to doxx private citizens, to go through people\u2019s garbage, to use secret identities\n(and then claim they don\u2019t), to print hacked data, to solicit leaks of private information\nwhile demanding to keep their own information private, to induce people to break\ncontracts, to stalk people at their homes, even to cover up enormous genocides and\nstart giant wars...always in the service of the bottom line, and some purported higher\ngood.\nThe establishment journalist claims to speak truth to power, but somehow never gets\naround to investigating themselves or each other.

There\u2019s an enormous incentive for estab-\nlishment journalists to engage in anti-competitive collusion, because if they all agree\non what is \u201ctrue\u201d, who can then fact-check them?

But the party is\nnot thesameas the state. Indeed, there are 95 million CCP members, and they don\u2019t\nall have senior government positions anymore than every registered Democrat has a\nplum spot in the Biden administration. Instead, they are spread out through society.\nHow does it work?\nJoining the CCP is itself nontrivial, which selects for the most dedicated members.\nTheSouth China Morning Post outlines the \u201carduous\u201d application process:\nAn application must be \ufb01led to the applicant\u2019s closest party committee or\nbranch, with a letter explaining:\n\u2022why he is applying for membership,\n\u2022why he believes in the Communist Party, and\n\u2022areas in which he feels he has fallen short of the requirement to become\na member.\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there, according to Merics:\nApplicants must write essays on Marxism-Leninism and on current political\ndevelopments. Eight colleagues, neighbors and acquaintances have to vouch\nfor an applicant\u2019s reputation.\nAfter applying, the applicant must take courses and then pass an exam, only to then\nbe put into a yearlong (at least) probationary period:\nThe applicant will then attend party courses, where he will learn about\nthe party\u2019s constitution, after which he will have to take and pass written\ntests...152 CHAPTER 3.

At the end of the probation period, the\nparty branch decides whether to admit the applicant, extend the probation\nor expel him.\nLest one misbehave during the probationary period, there are consequences if the ap-\nplicant does not behave up to strict standards:\nIn the ensuing one-year probation period, the admission process can still\nbe stopped if \u201cparty discipline\u201d is breached.\nAnd if you are \ufb01nally cleared by the Party to join, you have a lifelong commitment to\nuphold, as Mo Chen writes:\nWhen the CCP hold a top tier meeting, you will be in your local party\nbranch conference room to watch it live, and write essay on thoughts after\nview.\nNatural disasters happen, donate, mandatory.

America\u2019s CCP are its NPCs.\nWhy Is CCP Martial?\nFrom 1978 to 2013, from Deng Xiaoping to Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao, the CCP was\nfocused on economic growth. But under Xi Jinping, it\u2019s taken a turn towards militarist\nnationalism. It builds most of the world\u2019s physical products, its military budget is\nalready >1/3 that of America\u2019s, it has a more focused task (\u201creunify China\u201d rather\nthan \u201cpolice the world\u201d), it produces military recruiting videos like", "num_tokens": 2000}, "91": {"document": "We Will Always Be\nHere, and - most importantly - it is investing heavily in AI and drones.\nOn that last point, China is just better at deployment in the physical world than the\nUS government or military, as we can see from (a) the public infrastructure comparison,\n(b) the multibillion dollar failures of the American Ford-class aircraft carrier, the F-35\nmanned aircraft, the Littoral Combat Ship, and the Zumwalt destroyer, and (c) the\nfact that all the manufacturing know-how and the factories themselves are in China.\nRobotics could shift manufacturing out of China, but until then it is quite possible that\nthe \u201carsenal of democracy\u201d is more like the \u201carsenal of communism.\u201d\nNote however that just because China becomes primarily a martial power does not\nmean it will necessarily win a physical con\ufb02ict. The Nazis too in our framework were\nprimarily a martial power, and did not win. Then again, while the Nazis were out-\nnumbered by the US/UK/USSR by a 5:1 ratio (70M to 350M), the Chinese outnumber\nthe Americans by a roughly 4:1 ratio (1.4B to 330M), so past performance may not be\npredictive of future results.154 CHAPTER 3.

The global network of BTC\nholders in a key sense also stands abovestates, like the NYT network stands above the\nAmerican state and the CCP network stands above the Chinese state. Why? Because\nit\u2019s very hard for states to seize Bitcoin, in the absence of some kind of quantum\ncomputing breakthrough.\nBut it\u2019s primarily a money power rather than a moral power like NYT, or a martial\npower like CCP.\nThe less-obvious point is that BTC \u2014 and its adjacent group of web3 users \u2014 are be-\ncoming a mediapower that will eventually topple the NYT, much as the 20th century\nUS\u2019s media power eventually outcompeted that of the Soviet Union.

And it can spur much of the US military\ninto action with a fake article or three. So it has money and martial power, even if it\nis primarily a moral power.\nCCP endlessly preaches to its citizens via Xuexi Qiangguo , and until recently was\nfocused entirely on business. So it has a moral and money power as well, though it is\nbecoming primarily a martial power.\nFinally, Bitcoin certainly makes a set of implicit moral arguments: in\ufb02ation is bad,\ncentralization is bad, pseudonymity is good, and the like.

Because we aren\u2019t communists that believe\nin the historical inevitability of utopian outcomes, but technologists that believe in\nindividual initiative subject to practical constraints.\nThe previous two chapters were about those constraints, about the past and the im-\nmediate present. They orient us to discuss several possible futures, before picking out\none trajectory to focus on - the one where we materialize many startup societies, get a\nfew diplomatically recognized as network states, and rebuild high-trust societies via a\nrecentralized center.\nSome caveats before we begin, though.\nWhen it comes to the past, every history is, inevitably, just a story.That is, any\ntale of the past is necessarily abridged, abbreviated, edited, and idiosyncratic. You\ncan\u2019t convey 5000 years of written records any other way. And our tale of History\nas Trajectory is no di\ufb00erent: it\u2019s like the \u201cwhy now\u201d slide at the beginning of every\nentrepreneur\u2019s deck, a practical historyof particular events that lead to the feasibility\n159160 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION\nof the network state. But we cited our references, so you can check our facts.\nOn the topic of the present, our chapter on the Tripolar Moment is the section of the\nbook that is likely to be the most dated. Intentionally so, because we endeavored to\nmove most references to current or near-past events to this section.So, think of that\nchapter as being very much a worldview circa mid-2022; like the Kalman \ufb01lter, we\nreserve the right to incorporate new information to update it.\nNow to the subject of the future. As you\u2019ll see we do believe a recentralized center\nof pragmatic network states canemerge, and describe several scenarios where this\ncould happen. But our projections are just scenarios, and throughout we keep in mind\nvolatility, re\ufb02exivity, competing curves, and the consequent limits to predictability.\nFirst,volatility is rising because the internet increases variance. Social media is social\nvolatility (go viral or get canceled), and cryptocurrency is \ufb01nancial volatility (go to\nthe moon or get rekt). Volatility makes correct predictions more di\ufb03cult, but o\ufb00ers\nupside for those who predict correctly. And volatility is good for insurgents and bad\nfor incumbents, because the former only need to get lucky once while the latter need\nto keep staying lucky. It\u2019s no longer just individuals that are subject to high volatility,\nas entire countries can rise and fall overnight. So, in a high volatility environment,\nonly Bezos-style invariants remain constant. All other observations should be taken as\ntentative \u2014 they are true until they are suddenly not.\nRe\ufb02exivity is Soros\u2019 term for the feedback loop between participants\u2019 understanding\nof a situation and the situation in which they participate. In systems made of human\nbeings, putting something out into the world results in a reaction, and then a reaction\nto that reaction, and so on, often resulting in positive and negative feedback loops\nrather than textbook convergence to equilibria. Thus, when collecting data on such\nsystems, let alone forecasting them, one must keep in mind that people will reactto\npredictions themselves, sometimes to make them come true. In social science, unlike\nphysical science, every row in a dataset represents a human being with a mind of their\nown.\nThe concept of competing curves refers to the fact that there are many simultaneous\ntechnopolitical movements competing at the present moment, di\ufb00erent phenomena ris-\ning from zero to a\ufb00ect millions over the course of years, months, or even days. For\nexample, if you take a look at this graph of how people met their spouses, you can see\nseveral di\ufb00erent curves rising and falling as di\ufb00erent cultural movements \u201ccome online,\u201d4.1. THE POSSIBLE FUTURES 161\nuntil the internet just dominates everything. Another example is the market share of\nsocial networks over time; a third is Ray Dalio\u2019s graph of the rise and fall of nations.\nThepointisthatyoucanidentifytheplayers, butnotalwaystheoutcome, inacomplex\nmultiactor process. Applying this to our scenario analysis, we have some trends that\nare synergistic and others that are antagonistic. For example, many trendlines point to\ndiminished American power, but at least one points in the other direction: the West\u2019s\nwillingness to weaponize its tech giants for domestic and foreign con\ufb02icts alike. Does\nthis give American dominance another few years, another decade, or many more than\nthat? We can identify the curves but not always which ones win out.\nPredictability has its limits. In our view there are two kinds of predictions that matter:\nthe physical and the \ufb01nancial. The physical prediction is a very speci\ufb01c bet on the\ntrajectory of a ball, on a genomic base call, or on the electron con\ufb01guration of an\norbital. It\u2019s checked by reproducible experiment, and your device fails if it fails. The\n\ufb01nancial prediction is at the opposite end of the spectrum: it\u2019s a macroscopic bet on\nthe volatile, re\ufb02exive behavior of other human beings. It\u2019s checked by the unforgiving\nmarket, and your fund fails if it fails.\nWe aren\u2019t as interested in betting on manipulation-prone government statistics. Ac-\ncording to the Chinese government of 2021, the number of COVID deaths in China\nfrom mid 2020-2022 was zero. According to the San Francisco government of 2021,\nthe crime rate in SF was declining. According to the US establishment of 2021, the\nin\ufb02ation of the dollar was transitory. All this reminds us of the Soviet government of\n1932, who said the harvest in Ukraine was glorious.\nAs we discuss later, it isuseful to create on-chain shadow statistics that are more\nveri\ufb01able, reliable, and censorship-resistant than these easily faked indicators. But\noutside of that, predictions on o\ufb03cial government statistics are otherwise uninteresting\nbecause of how obviously political they are. So we steer clear of that kind of thing\n\u2014 in our analysis of possible futures, we\u2019ll either predict something is technologically\n(and hence physically) feasible, or that it could result in a \ufb01nancial return, or both.\nAnd we\u2019ll give recipes for how to make those predictions reality, or prevent them from\nbecoming reality, in the form of \ufb01ctional scenarios on good and bad futures.\nSo, to recap: our history is just a story, our analysis of the present may presently\nbe dated, and our forecasts for the future may be confounded by volatility, re\ufb02exivity,\ncompetingcurves, andthelimitsofpredictability.

Eventually what I realized is that everyone is patriotic\naboutsomething , and those people were patriotic about their city, while others were\npatriotic about their countries, companies, or even their cryptocurrencies.\nTo elaborate on this point, for someone who identi\ufb01es themselves as a San Franciscan,\ncriticism of the city is taken personally, because that isn\u2019t a swappable piece of their\nlife. Their company? That\u2019s just a job, it\u2019s replaceable, what they really care about is\nthe Golden Gate Bridge, the Presidio, the 49ers - a sort of romantic identi\ufb01cation with\nthe city itself, and many of the people that live there.\nOthers a\ufb03liate with their national identity \ufb01rst, above their city identity - they\u2019ll move\nbetween military bases at the drop of a hat, which are interchangeable, but they are\nwilling to kill and die for the \ufb02ag with which they identify. Or they might be \u201cbased\u201d\nout of Seattle for a time, signifying that their location is immaterial, while signaling\ntheir deep love for democracy online, an identity that is non-negotiable.\nStill others are patriotic about their companies, those things they\u2019ve founded and\nfunded, breathed life into, those entities that took all their capital and intellect to\nbuild, which are always far more fragile than they look from the outside, and which\nsome callous outsider could break for likes with a few morale-draining tweets.\nAnd yet others characterize themselves by their cryptocurrencies, thinking of them-\nselves \ufb01rst and foremost as Bitcoiners or Ethereans. These folks are often digital\nnomads, indi\ufb00erent as to whether they see the sunset in San Francisco or Singapore, or\nwhat crypto exchange lives or dies, so long as they can check in with their community\nof holders each day.\nIn each case, there\u2019s typically a large economic, social, or political stake in the thing\npeople are identifying with. The city patriot may be a homeowner or otherwise invested\nin city governance. The country patriot may have signed a military contract. The\ncompany patriot may be a founder or early employee with a signi\ufb01cant equity stake.\nAnd the cryptocurrency patriot is often a sizeable holder of coins.\nNow, not all things are like this; people can be right-handed without identifying them-\nselves as right handers, they can do something without being something. So top-level\nidentity, primary identity - that\u2019s precious, it\u2019s rare, it\u2019s the identity that supersedes all\nothers.

From a stable 9-5 job to a gig economy\ntask or a crypto windfall. From a standard life script to 30 year olds living with their\nparents and 20 year old startup CEOs.\nThis is a very general phenomenon. You see it in the dashboard of every internet\ndisruptor. With Uber, for example, relative to the time of a standard taxi ride, some\nUber trips are much longer and others much shorter.\nWhy is this happening? Because the internet connects people peer-to-peer. It disinter-\nmediates. In doing this it removes the middleman, the mediator, the moderator, and\nthe mediocrity. Of course, each of those words has a di\ufb00erent connotation. People are\nhappy to see the middleman and mediocrity go, but they don\u2019t necessarily want to see\nthe moderator and mediator disappear.\nNevertheless, at least at \ufb01rst, when the internet enters an arena, once the Network\nLeviathan rears its head, this is what happens. Nodes that had never met before,\ncould never have met before, now connect peer-to-peer. They can form something\nterrible like a Twitter mob, or they can form something amazing like ETH Research.\nYou get extreme downside and extreme upside.\nOne analogy is to a centrifuge. If you take a sample of biological \ufb02uid from your body\nandcentrifugeit, you\u2019llseeabunchoflayersthatwerepreviouslymixedtogether. Then\nthey all get separated out. That\u2019s what the internet is doing to society, to institutions.\nIt\u2019s just centrifuging it into its constituent parts, whether that be albums separated\ninto songs or newspapers disaggregated into articles.\nThat\u2019s the unbundling. Then comes the rebundling. The songs get grouped into\nplaylists, the articles grouped into Twitter feeds. This step too is pro\ufb01table; it\u2019s not\nthe same as what came before, it\u2019s a v3, it\u2019s a \ufb02exible bundle.

And they don\u2019t understand\nthat upward deviation is creating a more competent group of global leaders than the\nAmerican establishment, a more meritocratically selected group than the nepotists of\nthe East Coast.\nJust as it allowed Satoshi to rise.\nSocial Media is American Glasnost, Cryptocurrency is American Pere-\nstroika\nThere are two particular ways that the internet increases variance worth noting: social\nmedia and digital currency.\n\u2022Social media increases social volatility . You can go viral or get canceled, experi-\nencing large overnight gainsor losses in status.\n\u2022Digital currency increases \ufb01nancial volatility . You can go to the moon or \u201cget\nrekt,\u201d experiencing large overnight gains or losses in \ufb01nancial status.\nThere\u2019s a parallel in history for this: glasnost and perestroika. Mikhail Gorbachev, the\nlast Soviet leader, thought he could reform Soviet society by allowing more free speech\n(via glasnost) and free markets (via perestroika). He didn\u2019t quite understand what he\nwas in for. The resultant instability helped bring down the Soviet Union.\nSimilarly, social media is like American glasnost and cryptocurrency is American per-\nestroika. Just as Gorbachev unleashed free speech and free market reforms because he\nbelieved communism could be reformed, the US establishment actually bought their\nown narrative in the 1990s and 2000s about their ostensibly free and democratic soci-\nety. Only now are they realizing that the many speech and thought controls that their\npredecessors had set up and hidden in plain sight - like stringent regulations and high170 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION\ncapital requirements for broadcast content production - was actually the key to their\ncontinued power.\nNow that it\u2019s clear that the Internet is to the USA what the USA was to the USSR, that\nit\u2019s truly free speech and free markets, they are trying to tamp down the American\nSpring they\u2019ve unleashed, but it may be too late. Obama was in a sense arguably\nAmerica\u2019s Gorbachev, as he allowed technology to grow mostly unimpeded from 2008-\n2016, to billions of users, without fully realizing what would ensue.\nThe 100-Year Information Tsunami\nFew institutions that predated the internet will survive the internet.\nWhy? Because the internet increases variance, it causes huge surges of digital pressure\non older institutions that just weren\u2019t built for it. They can\u2019t handle the peak levels\nof social and \ufb01nancial stress that the internet can unleash. They\u2019re like seaside towns\nthat weren\u2019t built for a thousand year \ufb02ood. Michael Solana\u2019s post JUMPis quite good\non this topic.\nIndeed, this is a good analogy, because one of the ways to think about the internet is as\na carrier of massive information waves . Most normal waves propagate in physical space\n\u2013\u2013 the standard partial di\ufb00erential equations (PDEs) are 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional (e.g.\nlongitudinal waves like a slinky, transverse like electromagnetic waves, or earthquake-\nstylesphericalwaves).

If you\u2019re into electrical engineering,\nyou can think of this as analog, to analog/digital, to natively digital.\n\u2022One example is the transition from a piece of paper, to a scanner which scans\nthat \ufb01le into a digital version, to a natively digital text \ufb01le which begins life on\nthe computer and is only printed out when it needs to be.\n\u2022Another example is the transition from face-to-face meetings, to Zoom video\n(which is a scanner of faces), to natively digital VR meetings.\n\u2022Yet another example: physical cash, to something like PayPal or \ufb01ntech (which is\njust a scan of the pre-existing banking system), to the truly native digital version\nof money: cryptocurrency.4.3. TECHNOECONOMIC AXES 171\nOnce you see this pattern you can see it everywhere, and you can look for those spaces\nwhere we\u2019re still stuck at the v2, at the scanned version, where we\u2019ve taken the o\ufb04ine\nexperience and put it online, but not fundamentally innovated.\nTruly Digital News: Dashboards, On-Chain Event Feeds\nNewspapers are actually only partially digitized. In 1996, the primary version of The\nNew York Times was the physical paper and the mirror was the website. Then, grad-\nually, more and more weight got shifted to the digital version. Now it can fairly be\nsaid that the physical paper is just a printout of the website, a snapshot at a particular\ntime. And there are online-only features like interactive graphics that are impossible\nto replicate in the physical paper. Most importantly, the comments section is really\nsocial media, particularly Twitter, where all the reporters are located.\nBut this is still really just a newspaper, put online. Most of it canbe printed out.\nWhat\u2019s the next step in this evolution? What does natively digital news look like?\nThere are at least two concepts of interest here: morning dashboards replacing the\nmorning newspaper, and cryptographically veri\ufb01able event feeds replacing tweets of\nunveri\ufb01able content.\nDashboards > newspapers. If you are in tech, the \ufb01rst thing you look at each day\nmay be a personal or company dashboard, like your \ufb01tbit or your sales. This is good.\nThe \ufb01rst thing you look at each day shouldn\u2019t be random stories someone else picked.\nShould be carefully selected metrics you want to improve. This is a good vector of\nattack to de\ufb01nitionally disrupt newspapers.\nIf we think about it from Clayton Christensen\u2019s \u201cjobs to be done\u201d perspective, news-\npapers have this incredible pride-of-place \u2014 \ufb01rst thing you look at in the morning! \u2014\nbut typically do not add enough value to deserve that position.\nOn-chain event feeds > Twitter > newspapers. Onekeyobservationisthatjustasmany\nsports articles are digest of box scores, and many \ufb01nancial articles are summaries of the\nday\u2019s stock action, so too are many political and tech articles merely wrappers around\ntweets.\nBecause news breaks on Twitter. So, eventually, the next kind of newspaper will look\nsomething like a cryptographically veri\ufb01ed version of Twitter. The \ufb01rst draft of history\nwill be the raw on-chain event feed, written directly to the ledger of record by billions\nof writers and sensors around the world.\nIn other words, truly digital newspapers will be on-chain event feeds. Digitally signed\ncrypto oracles, not corporations.\nRemote Work to Remote Life\nMy friend Daniel Gross remarked that 2020 will be seen by future historians as the\nyear when the internet age truly began.172 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION\nThe lasting impact of COVID-19 is that it \ufb02ipped the world from physical to digital\n\ufb01rst. Because the internet in 2000 or 2010 couldn\u2019t bear the load of the entire physical\nworld. But by 2020, it kind of could. Now it\u2019s not just about remote work, but remote\nlife.\nDuring the pandemic, every sector that had previously been socially resistant to the\ninternet (healthcare, education, law, \ufb01nance, government itself) capitulated. Those\naspects of society that had been very gradually changing with technology shifted\novernight. For example, the convention of politeness shifted: now it was rude to ask\nfor an in-person business meeting, as you\u2019d do it remote if at all possible.\nWith vaccination, many of these things have \ufb02ipped back, but they won\u2019t come back\nall the way. Digitization was permanently accelerated.\nIt used to be that the physical world was primary, and the internet was the mirror.\nNow that has \ufb02ipped. The digital world is primary and the physical world is just the\nmirror. We\u2019re still physical beings, of course. But important events happen on the\ninternet \ufb01rst and then materialize in the physical world later, if ever.\nFrom Printing to Materializing\nAll value eventually becomes digital, because we are generalizing the concept of \u201cprint-\ning\u201d from inking a piece of paper to actually materializing digital things in the physical\nworld. This is counterintuitive, and you\u2019ll have objections. But let\u2019s get there in a few\nsteps.\n1.Much value creation is already digital. If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re probably\nan information worker. You may not have thought about it this way, but the\nmajorityofyourwakinghoursareprobablyspentinfrontofonescreenoranother\n\u2014 a laptop for work, a phone on the go, a tablet for reading, and so on. So,\nmost of your life is alreadyspent in the Matrix, in a sense, even before the\nadvent of widespread AR/VR. Short of a pullback to an Amish or Andaman\nIslander existence, most of your life is and will be digitally in\ufb02uenced in some\nform. Moreover, much of the value in the physical world comes from blueprints\ncreated on a computer in some form; eg, the iPhones manufactured in Shenzhen\ngain much of their value from the designers in California. So, a good fraction of\nvaluecreation is largely digital.\n2.More value creation is becoming digital. Read Packy McCormick\u2019s article on\n\u201cThe Great Online Game,\u201d and think about every information worker essentially\npressing buttons to earn cryptocurrency in a giant globalized internet economy.\nThat\u2019s what 2030 or 2035 is on track to look like.\n3.Much spending is already digital. Think about what fraction of your spending\nalready goes to digital goods like books, music, software-as-a-service, and the\nlike. Now think about what fraction of the remainder goes through a digital\ninterface of some kind, whether through an ecommerce website like Amazon or a4.3. TECHNOECONOMIC AXES 173\npoint-of-sale terminal via Apple Pay. So, it\u2019s already fairly uncommon for people\nin industrialized societies to do a fully o\ufb04ine purely physical transaction, which\nmight be conceptualized as \u201chand a \ufb01ve dollar bill over at a farmer\u2019s market for\nseveral tomatos.\u201d\n4.Many actions can be analogized to printing. Now take this one step further and\nthinkabouttheremainingo\ufb04inecomponentsas\u201cprinting\u201d somethingout, though\nyoucanusetheword\u201cmaterializing\u201d ifitsuits.

You can do the\nsame for the door to your coworking space o\ufb03ce, or the door to your electric car.\nSo, more and more of the goods people prize in the physical world are in a sense\n\u201cprinted\u201d out.\n5.Many printing actions can be fully automated. Today, there\u2019s a human in the loop\nforthingslikefooddelivery. Butasroboticsimproves, thiscouldintheorybecome\na completely electromechanical process, just like printing.

Everything starts on the computer,\ngenerates cryptocurrency, and can be used either to buy digital goods or to pay robots\nto materialize things in the physical world.\nHumans will still exist, of course, but the economy will become the cryptoeconomy.\nAll value goes digital.", "num_tokens": 145}, "113": {"document": "4.3.3 The Productivity Mystery\nWhat is the productivity mystery? Well, we really should be in the middle of a golden\nage of productivity. Within living memory, computers did not exist. Photocopiers did\nnot exist. Even backspace did not exist. You had to type it all by hand.\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that you couldn\u2019t search all your documents, sort them, back\nthem up, look things up, copy/paste things, email things, change fonts of things, or\nundo things. Instead, you had to type it all on a typewriter!\nIf you\u2019re doing information work, relative to your ancestors who worked with papyrus,\npaper, or typewriter, you are a golden god sur\ufb01ng on a sea of electrons. You can make\nthings happen in seconds that would have taken them weeks, if they could do them at\nall.174 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION\nWe should also be far more productive in the physical world. After all, our predeces-\nsors built railroads, skyscrapers, airplanes, and automobiles without computers or the\ninternet. And built them fast. Using just typewriters, slide rules, & safety margins.\nThis is a corollary to the Thiel/Cowen/Hall concept of the Great Stagnation. Where\nhas all that extra productivity gone? It doesn\u2019t appear manifest in the physical world,\nfor sure, though you can argue it is there in the internet world. There are a few possible\ntheses.\n1.The Great Distraction. All the productivity we gained has been frittered away\non equal-and-opposite distractions like social media and games.\n2.The Great Dissipation. The productivity has been dissipated on things like forms,\ncompliance, and process.\n3.The Great Divergence. The productivity is here, it\u2019s just only harnessed by the\nindistractable few. The founders of tech unicorns, for example, may have more\nability to focus online than most.\n4.The Great Dilemma. The productivity has been burned in bizarre ways that\nrequire line-by-line \u201cpro\ufb01ling\u201d of everything, like this tunnel study.\n5.The Great Dumbness. The productivity is here, but we\u2019ve just made dumb deci-\nsions in the West while others have harnessed it. See for example China building\na train station in nine hours vs taking 100-1000Xthat long to upgrade a Cal-\ntrain stop. Now, yes, I\u2019m sure not every train station in China is built in nine\nhours, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some regions in the US (or the West more\nbroadly) do better than SFBA. But feels likely that a systematic study would\n\ufb01nd a qualitative speed gap, 10-100X or more.\n6.The Great Delay. The productivity will be here, but is delayed till the arrival of\nrobotics. That is, for things we can do completely on the computer, productivity\nhas measurably accelerated. It is 100X faster to email something than to mail\nit. But a slow human still needs to act on it. So, in this hypothesis, humans are\nnow the limiting factor.\nEssentially, representing a complex project on disk in something like Google Docs\nmay not be the productivity win we think it is. Humans still need to comprehend\nall those electronic documents to build the thing in real life.\nSo the problem may be in the analog/digital interface. Do we need to actuate\nas fast as we compute? That would mean zero-delay robotic task completion\nwill be the true productivity unlock. And that we haven\u2019t gone full digital yet.\nSo long as humans are still in the loop, we won\u2019t get the full bene\ufb01ts of digital\nproductivity.4.3.

By default they\u2019ll swing to the\nDollar Green side, but many tech founders will lean Bitcoin Orange, so we could see\ncentralized tech companies supporting both sides \u2014 with older and fully woki\ufb01ed \ufb01rms\nlike Google \ufb01rmly on the Green side, and newer founder-controlled \ufb01rms located in\nplaces like Miami and Texas trending Orange.\nHow America Builds Towards Con\ufb02ict\nHow could something as radical as a Second American Civil War happen? You could\nwrite a book on this, and several people have, but in lieu of that we\u2019ll give a bullet\npointed list. Before reviewing it, you might want to re-read Ray Dalio, Peter Turchin,180 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION\nand Strauss & Howe if you want more context, as we won\u2019t be able to recapitulate\nevery citation that informs this projection. Done? OK, here we go.\n1.Political polarization is way up. All the graphs show this now. The US is not\nreally a \u201cnation state\u201d any more, but a binational country comprised of two war-\nring ethnic groups that disagree on fundamental moral premises. It is about \u201cgod,\ngays, and guns\u201d, but it\u2019s also also about censorship, surveillance, and in\ufb02ation.\n2.State capacity is way down. ThecompetentAmericaofmid-century, theleft/right\nfusion that FDR put together, the America that combined a powerful centralized\nstate with social conservatism, the America depicted in countless movies, the\nAmerica that won World War Two and the Cold War \u2014 that country is over.\nThis US government can\u2019t build a bathroom in San Francisco, let alone a cost-\ne\ufb00ective \ufb01ghter jet, destroyer, combat ship, or aircraft carrier.\n3.Economic prosperity is declining. All the political in\ufb01ghting of the last decade\nhappened during a period of relative prosperity, even if it was based on the\narti\ufb01cial expedient of printing money. But now that we face potentially years of\nin\ufb02ation and stagnation, unhappiness will increase. Already you\u2019re seeing articles\ncoming trying to acclimatize people to lower standards of living, to \u201ceat bugs and\nlive in a pod.\u201d And Turchin\u2019s cliodynamical graphs put numbers to these feelings.\n4.Envy is increasing. This is normally phrased in terms of \u201cinequality\u201d, and that is\nindeed one way to look at it, but let\u2019s rotate it by a few degrees and talk about\nenvy. The return of great fortunes, the rise of social media, and the decline in\nreligion has led to escalating envy. Every day, people can see others online who\nappear to be better o\ufb00 than they are, and who appear to be rising while they are\nfalling. Whether that rise is real or not, whether it is due to the other person\u2019s\nown e\ufb00orts or not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter to the person who feels they aren\u2019t\ngetting ahead, who feels they are falling behind.\nWithout a rising tide that lifts all boats, the \u201crational\u201d act for some is to sink the\nother boats, to pull escaping crabs down into the bucket. Why? Because misery\nloves company, and because stopping someone from getting too far ahead means\ntheycan\u2019toutcompeteyouforhousesormates. Theonlywayoutofthisnegative-", "num_tokens": 1999}, "121": {"document": "sum trap is to build provably positive-sum systems and high-trust societies. But\nthat\u2019s exactly what the US establishment is not doing.It\u2019s fomenting hatred\non social media every day, and giving new reasons not to trust it \u2014 whether that\nbe the insistent assurance that in\ufb02ation is transitory or all the other episodes of\no\ufb03cial misinformation.\n5.Foreign military defeat looms. Leaving aside your feelings about the pandemic,4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 181\nthe military propaganda beforehand is worth reviewing. In 2018, the US De-\npartment of Defense put out press releases on its preparation for a pandemic, on\nits sophisticated vaccines...and then nothing happened. This was the \ufb01rst time\nmany in the public had the opportunity to directly compare statements about\n\u201csecret military programs\u201d to the actual results, just as you might compare pro-\njections by corporate executives to the actual results. And the size of that gap\nwas remarkable. It indicated that at least some of the US military was just words,\nand not real.\nI remarked on this in early 2021, months before the defeat in Afghanistan gave\nyet another example of the gap between US military rhetoric and reality, where\nKabul wasn\u2019t going to fall in a few days and then it did.\nAs of this writing, we\u2019re four months into the Russo-Ukrainian war of 2022.\nAfter an initial surge of attention, global interest in the con\ufb02ict has dropped o\ufb00\na cli\ufb00. The New York Times and other establishment media outlets have now\ninstructed the US administration to pursue peace, and various reports indicate\nthat the Ukrainians are quickly plowing through ammunition stockpiles while the\nRussians are gaining ground with long-range artillery. To be clear, it\u2019s not at all\nobvious what will happen - there\u2019s fog of war with everything - but in the event\nof an outright Russian victory, de\ufb01ned as gaining territory they didn\u2019t have prior\nto the war, that wouldn\u2019t augur well for the US establishment.\n6.US states are pulling away from the feds. There\u2019s enormous coverage of US poli-\ntics at the national level, because it attracts clicks from all over. But local politics\ndoesn\u2019t get the same attention. However, if you\u2019ve been paying attention, there\nhasbeen a multi-decadal trend wherein states have been pulling away from the\nfederal government and each other on matters like guns, immigration, abortion,\ngambling, marijuana, and other matters. This is part of the Future is Our Past\nthesis: it\u2019s reversing the de facto 10th Amendment repeal by FDR\u2019s government,\nand more broadly is part of the gradual Western decentralization since the peak\ncentralization of 1950.\n7.Authority has lost respect. The old American left said something like \u201cwe all need\nto work for the common good\u201d while the old right said something like \u201cpay your\ndues and you\u2019ll achieve the American dream.\u201d The new left says \u201cwe are all equal\u201d\nand the new right says \u201cyou ain\u2019t the boss of me.\u201d So, the old left/right combina-\ntion supported self-sacri\ufb01ce and a stable hierarchy, while the new one attacks\nall hierarchy as fundamentally illegitimate, as oppressive or tyrannical. This is\nre\ufb02ected in the defacement and degradation of virtually every US institution over\nthe last few decades, from the o\ufb03ce of the presidency to the statues of American\nfounders. George Washington and the US Capitol are no longer sacred.182 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION\n8.National divorce is discussed. Secession is now o\ufb03cially part of the platform\nfor Texas\u2019 Republicans. And there have been an increasing number of pieces on\nthe topic of \u201cnational divorce\u201d from Democrats and Republicans alike, including\nNYMag (\u201cNo, We Can\u2019t Get a National Divorce\u201d), Stephen Marche ( The Next\nCivil War ), Barbara Walter ( How Civil Wars Start ), Michael Malice (\u201cThe Case\nfor American Secession\u201d), David Reaboi (\u201cNational Divorce Is Expensive, But It\u2019s\nWorth Every Penny\u201d), and the American Mind (\u201cThe Separation\u201d).\n9.Radicalized movements reject the status quo. There have been countless words\nwritten on wokeness, on how it\u2019s a radical ideology that thinks of the US as in-\ntrinsically corrupt \u2014 as systemically x-ist for many values of x \u2014 and therefore\ndoesn\u2019t really seek to reform America so much as to capture the state to com-\npletely transform it. See Wesley Yang, Richard Hanania, Matthew Yglesias, John\nMcWhorter, Bari Weiss, and many others for discussion of di\ufb00erent aspects of\nthis.\nThe thing about wokeness is that it\u2019s not just a super\ufb01cial weed growing out\nof the topsoil. It has a root system, a theory of history and ethics that\u2019s built\non thousands of papers, on generations of academic humanists, on Foucault and\nDerrida and the like, on deconstruction and critical race theory and so on. I\nhappen to think of it as a mostly evil doctrine, as sophisticated evil promoted in\nthe name of good, but I recognize it has ideological content.\nThe Republican party isn\u2019t really capable of dealing with that. But Bitcoin\nMaximalism is. If you haven\u2019t heard of it, you will. Bitcoin Maximalism is by\nfar the most important ideology in the world that many people haven\u2019t heard of\n- yet.\nThere\u2019s philosophical depth to Maximalism. It represents a root-and-branch re-\njection of the in\ufb02ation that powers the US government and thus pays for every-\nthing. It fuses the worldview of Mises, Rothbard, Hayek, and Ron Paul with\nBitcoin. It naturally aligns with the loss of trust in institutions, with the suspi-\ncious individual who (understandably!) no longer trusts the federal government\nor US institutions on anything. It\u2019s not merely an edit to the state, it\u2019s the end of\nthe state. And it\u2019s a push from an ideological direction the Wokes are ill-prepared\nfor, because it\u2019s an aracial ultra-libertarianism rather than the white nationalism\nthat folks like Marche and Walter thinkwill be their foe.\nIf you want to understand Bitcoin Maximalism, read The Bitcoin Standard or\nthe tweets from accounts at hive.one/bitcoin (not all are Maximalists). But be\naware: just like wokes who reject \u201ccivility\u201d on ideological grounds, maximalists\nhave developed verbal justi\ufb01cations for being \u201ctoxic.\u201d\nI disagree with the fundamental moral premise of Maximalism, which is that\nBitcoin is the only coin and all other digital assets are sins.I don\u2019t believe in4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 183\none coin anymore than I believe in one state or one god. But I understand the\npower that such a belief system has. Americans don\u2019t believe in one god anymore,\ndon\u2019t believe in monotheism. So their choice is between one state and one coin,\nbetween ideological monostatism and mononumism.\nThat is, to beat something like the US establishment in a civil con\ufb02ict, you don\u2019t\njust need bravery, you need a more powerful Schelling Point. That\u2019s what Bitcoin\nis for the Maximalists: the one coin that\u2019s the alternative to the one state. If and\nwhen the dollar collapses due to in\ufb02ation, the orange coin becomes the new blue\njeans, the global symbol of freedom and prosperity.\n(And what\u2019s the alternative to thatalternative? Many network states as al-\nternative to one nation state, many coins as alternatives to the one coin, many\nbeliefs as the alternative to one belief system. That\u2019s the polystatist, polynumist,\npolytheist model we describe later on in the Recentralized Center .)\n10.Bitcoin seizure could be the trigger event. All of this is a combustible mix, and\nthere are many possible trigger events, but one that I see as particularly likely is\na combination of (a) ruinous in\ufb02ation followed by (b) a soaring BTC/USD price\nand then (c) the attempt by an insolvent federal government to seize Bitcoin from\ncitizens.\nOn the Bitcoin side, this isn\u2019t a short-term price prediction or anything, and there\nare of course various possible failure modesfor BTC that could prevent Bitcoin", "num_tokens": 1999}, "122": {"document": "from being the speci\ufb01c cryptocurrency that drives this scenario. Nevertheless,\nbecause the Bitcoin protocol has mostly been technologically \ufb01xed for a while,\nits partisans have focused to a much greater extent on political innovation \u2013 like\ngetting it recognized as a sovereign currency. Add in the moral importance that\nMaximalists attach to Bitcoin, and its global name recognition, and BTC is likely\nto be the coin of contention.\nOn the other side, the general concept of asset seizure isn\u2019t really even very sci-\ufb01\ngiven the overnight freezing of funds for Canadian truckers and 145M Russian\nnationals. The main di\ufb00erence is that cryptocurrency is built to be hard to freeze.184 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION\nA bankrupt state can and will try to seize funds held at centralized exchanges,\nbut for those that have taken their funds o\ufb00 exchanges, the state will need to go\nhouse-to-house, and rubber hoses don\u2019t scale.\nA US establishment attempt to seize Bitcoin in a time of high in\ufb02ation would be\nlike a repeat of FDR\u2019s gold seizure (Executive Order 6102), except it\u2019d be done\nduring a time of declining state capacity rather than rising centralization.\nThe reason something like this could be the trigger event is that neither side could\neasily back down: Wokes would have no power if their state went bankrupt, and\nMaximalists would have no money if they surrendered to the state.\nThus, this seems like a relatively foreseeable event that could kick o\ufb00 the Sec-\nond American Civil War \u2014 especially if the seizure bill is passed by the federal\ngovernment and some states refuse to enforce it.\nHow could that happen? A state-level refusal to enforce might just be part of the\ngrowing divergence between states from the federal government and each other,\nsimilar to the justi\ufb01cation for sanctuary cities and the like. But if you wanted\na statutory rationale, you could imagine a Constitutional Amendment proposed\nto ban Bitcoin seizure, something that would put the right to hold BTC on par\nwith the right to free speech and the right to bear arms. Such an amendment\ncould be rati\ufb01ed by many states in the run up to a possible seizure bill. Even if\nit didn\u2019t pass nationally, any ratifying states would then cite their rati\ufb01cation to\njustify their refusal to enforce.\nA War for Minds, Not Lands\nIt\u2019s a mistake to think a Second American Civil War would look anything like the \ufb01rst\nCivil War, or like World War 2 for that matter. It\u2019d be nothing like the movies with\nhuge movements of uniformed soldiers, tanks, and planes.\nInstead it\u2019ll just be a continuation and escalation of what we\u2019ve seen over the last\nseveral years: a network-to-network war to control minds, rather than state-to-state\nwar to control territory. A fusion of America\u2019s domestic con\ufb02icts on social networks\nand its foreign con\ufb02icts in the Middle East.\nThe best way to visualize this is to look at the physical map of Union-vs-Confederate\nright before the Civil War, the physical map of Republican-vs-Democrat by county,\nand then the digital map of Republican-vs-Democrat in the same period.\nInthe\ufb01rstCivilWar, ideologyandgeographystronglycoincided. Thevictorycondition\nfor the North was obvious: invade the South. Conquer the territory to conquer the\nminds. They didn\u2019t have to kill every last Confederate, they just had to show that\nresistance was futile to get the remaining Confederates to stop \ufb01ghting.\nIn any second Civil War, ideology and geography would only weakly coincide. Look\nagain at that map by county. Is one side really going to invade the other? Or vice4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 185\nversa? Is the US establishment going to seize corn \ufb01elds or will its opponents move to\ncapture big blocks of cities? Is either side going to use huge bombs on territories where\nthey\u2019d kill at least 30% of their own team? Could nuclear weapons be targeted enough\nto use as political tools to get the other side to concede?\nNo. Instead it\u2019ll be a war for minds, not lands. And if we look at the map of digital\nspace, suddenly much becomes clear. Here, the two sides are fully separated, as the\nUnion and Confederacy were. And now we can see why there\u2019s been such an emphasis\non cancellation, deplatforming, silencing, and shunning...on making people say certain\nwords and hoist certain symbols. Because making a person or a company post a\nparticularhashtagindicates control of minds whichisinturn control of digital territory .\nAll the discussion over the last few years around \u201cfree speech\u201d doesn\u2019t really engage the\nfundamental issue, which is that this is a time of information war, where the victory\ncondition for one side is to invade the minds of the other side \u2013 because it cannot\nfeasibly invade the territory.\nTo invade the minds of the other side, and to control the digital networks \u2013 because\nthe tech companies that greenlight transactions, communications, and online behavior\nhave in many ways become the de facto privatized governments of the Western world.\nThe power to determine what people can and cannot do in the digital world belongs to\nthe people who run these networks. And so controlling these networks, by controlling\nthe minds of people who run them, is the key to maintaining control over the US in a\ndigital time. That\u2019s why there\u2019s been such a push by the US establishment to wokify\nthe big tech companies.\nHowever, a network that can\u2019t be controlled in this way, and that isn\u2019t run by any one\nperson \u2013 like Bitcoin \u2013 well, that\u2019s a form of resistance. The set of web3 networks that\nare more decentralizedthan centralized Silicon Valley tech companies, that are run\nby communities \u2013 those too are a form of resistance.\nAs such, if the \ufb01rst Civil War was the \u201cWar Between the States\u201d, the second Civil War\nwill be the \u201cWar Between the Networks.\u201d The graphs we\u2019ve shown relate to Red-vs-\nBlue, but add a tint of yellow to each group and rotate it a bit. Then you\u2019ll get what\nwe think is the likely future axis of con\ufb02ict, which is Bitcoin-Orange-vs-Dollar-Green.\nIn areas where Greens control the state, they may use militarized police, tech company\nsurveillance, deplatforming, denunciation in media, arrests, seizures, and the like. In\nthose areas, Orange may respond with an insurgency campaign that looks like Northern\nIreland or the Middle East. But in areas where Oranges control the state, and Greens186 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION\nare in the minority, these tactics could reverse. Think about the BLM riots, or Jan 6,\nor the doxxing of Supreme Court Justices by angry establishmentarians, or the various\nstreet \ufb01ghts between right and left, or the constant digital struggle that plays out online\nevery day, and project out a future where those kind of network warfare tactics become\ndaily occurrences. Like the portmanteau \u201clawfare\u201d, think of this as \u201cnetwar.\u201d\nMaximalist vs Woke Rotates Left and Right\nThe reason the terms \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d don\u2019t exactly \ufb01t for the projected con\ufb02ict of\nOrangevsGreenisthatinmanyrespectstheBitcoinOrangewouldbethe revolutionary\nclassfaction and the Dollar Greens would be the ruling class faction.\nBasically, those who side with the US establishment in this scenario would be the\nsame personality type as those who sided with the ancien regime during the French\nRevolution: they\u2019d be \ufb01ghting to preserve the past. Their message would be one of\nparticularism, of American nationalism, of continued dollar supremacy.\nBy contrast, those who side with Bitcoin Maximalism would be a revolutionary per-\nsonality \ufb01ghting to overturn what they saw as tyranny. Their message would be one\nof universalism, of a system that puts everyone worldwide on the same playing \ufb01eld \u2014\nand that doesn\u2019t privilege America over the rest of the globe like the dollar does.\nThis will be an extremely uncomfortable position for the US establishment, because\nfor the \ufb01rst timein memory they\u2019ll represent the technologically conservative faction,\nthe less universalist side, the pre-modern side.\nBut you can already see the foreshadowing in terms of how legacy media inveighs\nagainst technology, how they hate the future, how they want to jam social media and", "num_tokens": 1982}, "123": {"document": "the internet back into the garage, how they want to turn back the clock on all those\nthings that have disrupted their political control.\nMaximalism is thus a kind of leapfrogging. If Trump invoked a mythical past, and the\nUS establishment represents an attempt to freeze the present in amber, the Bitcoin\nMaximalists are willing to drive the system towards an uncertain future. That\u2019s why\na fair number of conservative Republicans will side with Green, and why revolutionary\nDemocrats will side with Orange. Bitcoin Maximalism is a movement that knows it\ncan\u2019t \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d, because that America no longer exists and perhaps\nnever did, so it\u2019s willing to take the entire \ufb01at system down.\nOrange is thus comfortable with a higher level of chaos than a suddenly conservative\nUS establishment. It is ok with the uncertainty of crypto-anarchy over the certainty of\nin\ufb02ationary tyranny. And it is not looking to mend the federal government, but to end\nit. Unlike the reformist Republican, Maximalism is playing to win. And so it might.4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 187\nWho Wins?\nIt\u2019s extremely di\ufb03cult to forecast what happens, but I do think that in the long run\nthe Maximalists may win at least someterritory in a Second American Civil War,\nbecause they\u2019ll eventually outlast the money printing of the US establishment. The\nvalue proposition in the American regions that go Maximalist will be \u201cfreedom\u201d, though\nothers will perceive it as anarchy.\nWhy could Maximalists win a war of attrition? Every day the price of BTC/USD goes\nup is another victory in the Maximalist social war against the US establishment; every\nday it goes down is a temporary defeat.Because the US government can\u2019t invade\nthe rest of the world, and because other states won\u2019t necessarily listen to it, it can\u2019t\neasily seize Bitcoin globally. So long as the long-term price trend is up, which is not\nguaranteed, then Maximalists win.\nThat does lead to a related point: with an estimated 300M cryptocurrency holders\nworldwide at the time of writing, hundreds of millions of people who aren\u2019t Maximal-\nists already believe in Bitcoin. And it\u2019s on track to be billions by 2030. So long as\nthose holders don\u2019t sell their Bitcoin, that\u2019s a fundamentally new international support\nnetwork of a kind that MAGA Republicans don\u2019t have. That is, a man in Brazil doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily care about American Republicans vs Democrats \u2014 he\u2019s not an American\nnationalist, and doesn\u2019t have a dog in that \ufb01ght \u2014 but he may well hold Bitcoin. And\nso long as he doesn\u2019t sell BTC for dollars, he\u2019s indirectly supporting Maximalists. Yet\nhis foreign support comes in an intangible and ideological form that feels acceptable to\nthe proud American Bitcoin Maximalist, as opposed to (say) the explicit support of a\nforeign military getting involved on US soil.\nWith that said, the US establishment could also win a war of attrition. Their starting\nadvantages are immense: the universities, the media, the military, the intelligence\nagencies, most of the tech companies, and the federal government itself. The US\nestablishment also has an elite global support base: all the people who sympathize\nwith it around the world: the McKinsey types, the Ivy grads, the frequent \ufb02yer class,\nand the people who still think America is the country from the movies.Even if\nthe establishment can\u2019t force foreign governments to seize BTC, they may try seizing\nBitcoin for their own reasons, though other states will instead vector towards the\ndirection of economic freedom.188 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION\nMoreover, even if the US establishment does lose someterritory, it will likely hang\non to the Northeast and the West Coast. The value proposition in those regions that\nstick with the establishment will be \u201cdemocracy\u201d, though others will perceive it as \ufb01at\n\u201ctyranny\u201d.\nDuring all this, the pressure of con\ufb02ict could force people to the ideological extremes.\nTheclosestmoviearchetypesfortheGreenandOrangesidescouldbeamoreoppressive\nversionofPortlandiaandamorefunctionalversionofMadMax. Cartoonishcaricatures\ncome to life.\nWars Aren\u2019t Romantic\nIf it\u2019s not abundantly clear, I take no sides here, and am not rooting for anarchy. I\u2019d\nprefer a stable world where we could focus on mathematics and getting to Mars than\nthe chaos that may soon ensue. And I have no illusions about how bad civil con\ufb02ict can\nget; there are no unscathed winners in wars. Read David Hines for a good depiction of\nwhat political violence is actually like.\nPolitical violence is like war, like violence in general: people have a fan-\ntasy about how it works. This is the fantasy of how violence works: you\nSMITE YOUR ENEMIES IN A GRAND AND GLORIOUS CLEANSING\nBECAUSE OF COURSE YOU\u2019RE BETTER.\nGrand and glorious smiting isn\u2019t actually how violence works. I\u2019ve worked\na few places that have had serious political violence. And I\u2019m not sure how\nto really describe it so people get it. This is a stupid comparison, but here:\nimagine that one day Godzilla walks through your town. The next day, he\ndoes it again. And he keeps doing it. Some days he steps on more people\nthan others. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all he does: trudging through your town,\nback and forth.\nYour town\u2019s not your town now; it\u2019s The Godzilla Trudging Zone.\nPoint: civil con\ufb02ict is not romantic, it\u2019s not targeted, it\u2019s not proportional. It\u2019s insane.\nIf you think the scenario of American Anarchy is a possibility, you probably want to\nget as far away from it as you can, regardless of your \u201csympathies\u201d with either side.\nAnd then you should help build a peaceful alternative to American Anarchy.

China has also been using COVID quarantine codes to stop people from moving\nmoney or moving around. And Chinese capital controls, always strict, may get even\nmore intense with the rollout of the digital yuan. So that makes exit hard.\nConversely, on the entrance side, while it will still be possible for approved Chinese\ncitizens to travel to places like Iran or Russia that are e\ufb00ectively military allies, the\ncountries where the Chinese state lacks a hard power presence will start turning down\nChinese nationals due to espionage concerns. This has already been happening.\nThis combination of outbound restrictions imposed by theirgovernment and inbound\nrestrictions from othergovernments will make life hard for the Chinese liberals and\ninternationalists who disagree with the system, the \u201crunxue\u201d types. They won\u2019t be\nable to politically dissent, but it\u2019ll also be hard for them to leave the country with their\nproperty, as many will want to do. Such an act will be prevented or portrayed as a\ntraitorous run-on-the-bank, particularly if the economy isn\u2019t doing well. Think about190 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION\nhow enthusiastic Putin has been about the \u201crenationalization of the elites\u201d, and how\nclosely the CCP has been watching Western tactics during the Russo-Ukraine War.\nThey recognize that any commercial linkage with the West is a point of vulnerability\nduring a con\ufb02ict. So it\u2019s quite likely that CCP will increasingly make it di\ufb03cult for\npeople to exit physically or digitally.\nThe Path to Chinese Control\nWhat are the factors that lead us to this prediction, that CCP will emphasize the\n\u201cloyalty\u201d part of Hirschman\u2019s triad and turn strongly against both voice andexit?\n1.Shutting down opposition across the spectrum. This plot from MERICs is worth\nlooking at, as it reminds us that the CCP is not solely against US-style \u201cdemoc-\nratization\u201d, but also against many di\ufb00erent kinds of ideologies that di\ufb00er from\nthe party-state\u2019s current line. Whether that opposition is Maoist (like Bo Xilai),\ndemocratic (like Hong Kong and Taiwan), Islamic (like the Uighurs), Christian\n(like the churches), technologist (like Jack Ma and other founders), or even ultra-\nnationalist, the CCP stands at the middle of an ideological circle and constantly\nmonitors everyone for deviation.\n2.Inculcating Chinese nationalism. Just as the US has gone through a Great Awo-\nkening since the 2013, Chinese society has been driven by Xuexi Qiangguo into a\nphase of ultra-nationalism. There is opposition to this internally, but it remains\nto be seen whether it actually \ufb02ipsthe nationalism or simply moderates it.\n3.Building a surveillance state. Much has been written on this, but the sheer scale\nof what has been built isn\u2019t well understood. While it\u2019s worth being aware of\nGell-Mann amnesia, this is actually an area where US establishment media is\ncloser to reality than it is domestically, in part because relative to the Chinese\nstate it\u2019s actually opposition media. See videos like this from DW and this.\n4.Hooking it into AI. Read Kai-Fu Lee\u2019s AI Superpowers and then read this, this,\nandthis. SupplementitwithDanWang\u2019sletters, orthis2019postfromaChinese\nintellectual published at Reading the Chinese Dream that is still able to question\nthe deployment of all the surveillance.\n5.Piloting the system during COVID. The green/yellow/red health codes rolled out\non WeChat during the early days of COVID are used for travel restrictions - and\nhave been repurposed to simply prevent people from traveling in a deniable way.\n6.Cutting o\ufb00 digital and physical exit. Misbehavior in China can get you removed\nfrom WeChat, which is like unpersoning you given how many services it\u2019s hooked\ninto, public and private. More recently, China has repeatedly made it di\ufb03cult\nto leave the country on the grounds that doing so would spread COVID: \u201cTrips\nin or out of the country made by mainland citizens in 2021 plunged nearly 80%\ncompared with the level in 2019, NIA data showed.\u201d\n7.Selling to other governments. Both China and the US have sold surveillance4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 191\ntechnology to the globe, but one di\ufb00erence is that China can execute better in\nthe physical world - so smart cities built with Chinese technology have full-stack\nsurveillance.\n8.Justifying as anti-imperialism. The educational system and the big-screen movies\nlikeBattle of Lake Changjin andWolf Warrior 2 position China as defending\nitself from Western imperialism. And this \ufb01lters down to the small scale, like\nthis video of an o\ufb03cial defending Shanghai\u2019s lockdown with the narrative that\nChina will eventually have a war with the US, so citizens need to get in line for\nthe lockdown.\n9.Pointing to relative stability. The \u201cHarmonious Society\u201d narrative begun under\nHu Jintao has been mentioned less in an international context by Xi Jinping,\nwho has not exactly been pursuing harmony abroad. But it\u2019s still a useful tool\nto justify social control \u2013 like NYT talks about censorship and social controls to\npreserve \u201cdemocracy\u201d, CCP talks about censorship to maintain \u201charmony.\u201d\n10.China Coup could be the trigger event. The US establishment has put out videos\nand articles that come close to calling for a coup in China. George Soros broadly\nhints at it in speeches like this. And folks like Roger Garside literally wrote a\nbook on it.\nAn attempted coup, whether actually American-backed or simply accused of being\nsuch, could be the trigger event for rolling out a fearsome system of Chinese Control.\nAI would be turned on the population, and any even mildly Western-sympathic groups\nwould be pattern-recognized and dug out by their roots.

It could get very ugly.", "num_tokens": 1984}, "125": {"document": "The last part is important: Chinese Control would have signi\ufb01cant popular support.\nThe country is heavily nationalist now.

I may be\nwrong about this, but putting it all on one person or even one party doesn\u2019t feel right.\nThe ideological current towards Chinese ultra-nationalism feels stronger than Xi the\nperson, or even the CCP, and may outlast him in the event of a black swan.\nAnyway, with the coup defeated, CCP would then sell a turnkey version of their coup-\ndefeating surveillance state to other countries as a way to (a) stop any possible con-\ntagion of American anarchy, (b) control crime, (c) prevent increasingly mobile citizens\nfrom leaving with their funds to other countries, and (d) prevent unrest of any kind, le-\ngitimate or not. It would ensure that any leader currently in charge remains in charge,\nand would be picked by many governments for exactly that reason.192 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION\nChina Caveat\nThere\u2019s an important caveat to all this. Much Western coverage of China is unremit-\ntingly negative. And certainly the scenario described herein is not a particularly rosy\none. But we need to temper that negativity with a dose of realism.\nFirst, why are we even discussing China? Why aren\u2019t we discussing Chad or Chile?\nBecause China has on balance executed phenomenally well since 1978. After Deng\nXiaoping\u2019s reforms, the country really has risen to the workshop of the world, with an\nenormous trade surplus, a surfeit of hard currency, and dozens of huge new cities. It\u2019s\nthe #2 economy, the #2 military, and the #2 in tech unicorns. All of that happened\nfrom a standing start over the last 40-odd years, since Deng\u2019s turnaround of China\n(called Boluan Fanzheng).\nConversely, over the last 30 or so years, the US establishment has squandered perhaps\nthe greatest lead in human history, going from complete and uncontested dominance in\n1991 to internal con\ufb02ict and potentially implosion. Moreover, as noted in What about\nChina, huh? , it\u2019s not that the US establishment is more ethicalthan the CCP when\nit comes to civil liberties, it\u2019s just less competent. After all, the US establishment\nalso does warrantless surveillance via the NSA, unconstitutional search and seizure via\nthe TSA, arbitrary con\ufb01scation of property via civil forfeiture, censorship of political\nkeywords just like WeChat, and has pushed for disinformation agencies, civilian dis-\narmament, digital censorship, and the like. The US establishment copied the CCP\non lockdown, without ever really admitting it was doing so, and funded the lab that\nmay have leaked the coronavirus. It\u2019s also bombed and destabilized many countries\naround the world. And if we\u2019re honest, over the last two decades, the US has killed\nand displaced far more people abroad than the CCP has.\nThat might be hard to hear for a Westerner, but what all of that means is that (a)\nthe CCP does have some cred with many \u201cneutral\u201d countries, (b) it also has cred with\nhuge swaths of its own population thanks in part to both nationalist propaganda and\nactual execution, (c) that relative cred will grow if America descends into anarchy, (d)\nthe cred will make it easier for CCP to roll out more Chinese Control at home and\nabroad, and (e) the cred will actually attract some Chinese ancestry people back to\nChina even as others want to leave.\nWait \u2013 that last point seems paradoxical. How could people want to come to Chinese\nControl if we\u2019ve just spent all this time talking about so many want to leave?\nThink about Microsoft. It\u2019s a strong company. Most people in the world would be glad\nto get a job at Microsoft. But many of the very best would \ufb01nd it sti\ufb02ing, and would\ninstead strike out on their own to join or found a tech company. There\u2019s simultaneously\na demand for some people to join Microsoft while others want to leave.\nIn the case of China, this is compounded by China\u2019s evaporating soft power in regions\nwhere it doesn\u2019t have hard power. The climate of suspicion towards Chinese nationals\nhas ramped up dramatically in recent years, and it\u2019s generally not \ufb02agged as \u201cracism\u201d4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 193\nby the establishment press. This could make a good number of Chinese ancestry people\nleave rather than be singled out in the event of a hot con\ufb02ict.\nSo, that\u2019s what could happen to China: signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02ows of Chinese ancestry people,\nalong with some out\ufb02ows (or blocked out\ufb02ows) of elites.\nAnd the Chinese Control scenario we\u2019ve described, while dystopian to the ambitious\nand freedom-seeking, will likely be acceptable to many people who prize stability over\nall else and see scenes of \ufb02ames and gun\ufb01re (whether representative or not) coming\nfrom American Anarchy.

That\u2019s India and Israel,\nbut also American centrists, Chinese liberals, global technologists, and people from\nother places that want to steer a di\ufb00erent course from the US establishment, from\ncrypto-anarchy, andfrom Chinese Control.\nWhy mention India and Israel so prominently? Call it a hunch, but those two groups\nare #1 and #2 in immigrant tech founders in the US. India is, separately, also #3 in\ntech unicorns after the US and China. At the state level India and Israel are now highly\naligned, and at the individual level Indians and Israelis tend to be globally \ufb02exible and\nEnglish-speaking.\nSo, insofar as there is a third technological pole outside the US and China, it will prob-\nably have signi\ufb01cant Indo-Israeli character, with servers positioned in their respective\nterritories, and deals inked across borders.\nOf course, it will also have contributions from all around the world.

Still,\nit\u2019s worth a hearing.\nChina Can Make a Pencil\nThis is a scenario where the CCP wins, and Chinese Control triumphs.4.6. VICTORY CONDITIONS AND SURPRISE ENDINGS 195\nHow might China become the most prosperous and stable country in the world, even\nif it\u2019s unpopular in some places abroad, and even if the US attempts to \ufb01nancially or\nsocially sanction it? China would become an autarkic autonomous autocracy.\nTo understand this, let\u2019s start with a famous libertarian story: \u201cThe Pencil.\u201d The\nidea is that no one person can make a pencil. After all, a seemingly simple pencil is\ncomposed of wood, graphite, yellow paint, the metal that contains the eraser, and the\neraser rubber itself. But creating each of these things in-house would require running a\nvariety of di\ufb00erent agricultural and mining operations. So instead of having one person\ndo all of that, the capitalist system makes a pencil in a \u201cnetworked\u201d way. We use\nprices as an API, so that di\ufb00erent organizations can spin up, produce components in a\ncost-e\ufb00ective way, use their pro\ufb01ts to grow or maintain themselves, and adapt without\ncoordinating with each other.\nBut that was then. Maybe Chinese Communism with the digital yuan is di\ufb00erent.\nWhat happens if you have a computer system which really doesknow about every\nvendor, that has every record of every payment, that can actually see the global supply\nchain, and that knows every single person (or robot) required to make that pencil? It is\na large, but \ufb01nite problem after all. Maybe such a system can solve Hayek\u2019s calculation\nproblem.\nWe already have proof points for this. If you run a two-sided marketplace, you\u2019ll \ufb01nd\ncontra Hayek that not allknowledge is local. For example, Sidecar lost to Uber because\ndrivers set prices themselves, as opposed to setting them centrally. Hayekians would\nagree that Sidecar\u2019s approach was optimal: drivers have local knowledge and central\nplanning can\u2019t work. But Uber\u2019s central planning didwork. They had a global view\nof supply & demand. And riders wanted speed, not price shopping.\nSo, that\u2019s what this win scenario contemplates. If China integrates AI with the digital\nyuan, and makes their entire economy computable, at their scale they might actually\nbe able to make a pencil. And everything else.\nRecall that previous abstractions like \u201csix degrees of separation\u201d or \u201cwritten history\u201d be-\ncame very real once social networks digitized decades of interaction and communication\nby billions of people. So too would previous verbal abstractions like \u201cthe economy\u201d or\n\u201cthe supply chain\u201d become actual computable objects when you have every transaction\nand vendor in the same database. Basically, all the blockchain supply chain concept\nactually couldwork, but only if all payments (and hence receipts) are on-chain \u2014 or\nin something likea blockchain, which is what the digital yuan may be.\nThis is doubly true if AI-driven robots are carrying out many of these functions. China\nmight be able to internalize huge swaths of the economy. It could mean full stack\nproduction of everything, hyperde\ufb02ation of living costs within China, where labor be-\ncomes electricity. In this scenario, no oneperson can make a pencil, but Chinacan\nmake a pencil, because they can algorithmically coordinate the supply chain of millions\nof cooperating humans in a way no one has ever been able to do before. They\u2019d still\nneed the raw materials, but their alliances with African countries, Russia, and places196 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION\nlike Iran might take care of that.\nIt\u2019s essentially the vision of Red Plenty , Soviet-style central planning made feasible\nwith superior computation androbotics \u2014 so that the robots actually did what you\nsaid they\u2019d do, and didn\u2019t have that pesky self-interest getting in the way like humans\ndid. It\u2019d be a ri\ufb00 on Aaron Bastani\u2019s fully automated luxury communism, where the\ncommunistic parts would be the robotic parts \u2014 as they would lack any economic\ninterests of their own, and move as one.\nIn this win scenario, the Chinese Communists might have the highest standard of living\non the planet, as much higher than the US as the US was relative to the USSR, not\nonly because they actually make physical things, but because they could see the full\nstack, have data on everything, track every transaction, and deploy AI and robotics in\nthe physical world.\nOf course, that standard of living would be achieved in an ethnonationalist society\nwith a bone to pick with the US in particular. And it might result in a Greater East\nAsian Co-Prosperity Sphere 2.0, this time under Chinese rather than Japanese terms.\nEveryone would have to bend to Chinese hard power to get the bene\ufb01t of their robotic\neconomy.\nIn this scenario, the Chinese might even choose to copy the tactics America used in\nthe Russo-Ukrainian war: namely, physically sanction any group or state that opposes\nthem, thereby cutting them o\ufb00 from the supply of goods from an increasingly physically\nautarkic China.\nI don\u2019t like this world, because it cuts against the convenient outcome of the late 20th\ncentury, in which the system that produced freedom also produced prosperity.

The Soviet Union\nactually voted with the US in the UN Security Council to condemn Iraq.

VICTORY CONDITIONS AND SURPRISE ENDINGS 197\nThere\u2019s also an implicit version of it, where they team up without teaming up. The US\nestablishment on many levels admires the CCP crackdown on speech. For example, in\nThe Atlantic they said China took the right course on internet speech, and in the NYT\nthey noted that Free Speech Is Killing Us.

If a state can\u2019t coerce, it can\u2019t pay to enforce conscription, or pay the conscripts\nthemselves, or seize the money to pay for all the equipment needed to prosecute the\nexpensive industrialized wars of the 20th and early 21st century.\nThere\u2019s a book called Gold, Blood, and Power: Finance and War Through the Ages\nthat describes how \ufb01nance was a weapon of war, and that the 20th century was one of\nthe \ufb01rst times where huge wars have been fought without any country running out of\nmoney. The only thing the countries ran out of were bodies, because they were giant\ncentralized states that could seize everything in their territory, and could propagandize\neveryone in their territory, and could just drive total war. So the Nazis, Soviets, and\nAmericans just grabbed everything in their territory to \ufb01ght these wars, like enormous\nghosts that commanded millions of bodies in these titanic ideological combats.\nHow did they command those bodies? If you think about The Tripolar Triangle, the\nlower left corner of NYT is voice, and it\u2019s convincing people with words. The lower\nright corner of BTC is choice or exit, and it\u2019s convincing people with money. You can\nthink of these as left and right democracy respectively.\nBut there\u2019s a third pole. The top pole is loyalty. It\u2019s CCP. Today, it\u2019s AI. And it\u2019s\nconvincing people without convincing people at all. Because they\u2019re all literally one.\nIt\u2019s harmony.

And unlike a human soldier, a robot doesn\u2019t need to be\npaid, just charged.\nSo: the problem is that Bitcoin could end human war, but not robot War. There would\nstill be the question of funding the industrial capacity to manufacture the robots in the\n\ufb01rst place.

Nothing else has as much legitimacy, as many backlinks.\nAssumptions of the Nation State System\nWe can describe the assumptions of the nation state system in a di\ufb00erent lens, one\nthat makes it easier to understand the di\ufb00erences between this system and the network\nstate system we will introduce in the following pages:\n\u2022Physical \ufb01rst. The physical map of the world is primary.\n\u2022Composition . In theory, a nation state is composed of a single nation (the people)\nand an administrative entity (the state). In practice, some \u201cnation states\u201d are\nreally multinational empires, while some nations are stateless nations.\n\u2022No terra incognita. The modern nation state system takes for granted that there\nis noterra incognita : that the map of the physical world is fully known, such that\nit can be subdivided.\n\u2022No terra nullius. The system also takes for granted that there\u2019s no terra nullius ,\nno unclaimed land. With few exceptions, every piece of land on the surface of\nthe earth is spoken for by one and only one state. Much of the ocean is likewise\nsplit up this way, aside from international waters.\n\u2022Top-down division of land. The fully visible map is carved into geographical\nregions called states, with borders precisely demarcated by latitudes and longi-\ntudes.\n\u2022One state per citizen. People are typically citizens of just one state, changing\ncitizenship is infrequent, and most citizens are governed by the same state as\ntheir parents. The primary method of citizenship is still jus sanguinis , by birth.\n\u2022Legitimacy from physical control and electoral choice. A nation state\u2019s legitimacy\ncomes from a few sources. First, the state needs to be good enough at violence to\nactually control the territory it claims. Second, but really secondarily, the state\nis supposedly legitimized by the support of their underlying nation and their\ndemonstrated respect for universal human rights. (It\u2019s unfortunately a secondary\npoint because any group that is in de facto control of territory for long enough5.2. ON NATION STATES 203\neventually gets recognized.) Ideally, a legitimate state re\ufb02ects the will of its\npeople while also respecting the rights of the individual \u2013 giving voice to the\nmasses and the minority alike.\n\u2022Centralized administration. The administrators of the state, frequently an exec-\nutive and a legislature, write laws on paper to specify what is mandatory and\nforbidden. These laws are typically interpreted by a judiciary and enforced by\nmen with guns. And in the nation state system, every piece of land is adminis-\ntered by exactly one state, regardless of who is on it.\n\u2022Domestic monopoly of violence. Eachstatekeepsorderwithinitsbordersthrough\napoliceforce. Citizenswhodefythelawaresubjecttoincreasinglevelsofviolence\nuntil they comply, as per Grand Theft Auto .\n\u2022International sovereignty via military. In principle, states aren\u2019t supposed to\ninterfere with the domestic a\ufb00airs of other states. In practice, a state only main-\ntains sovereignty if it is competent enough in defending against domestic and\nforeign rivals alike, via its police, intelligence agencies, and military.\n\u2022Diplomatic recognition via bilateral and multilateral fora. States may sign bilat-\neral agreements with each other, or they may be recognized by multilateral fora\nlike the UN, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Monetary\nFund (IMF), and the G-20. Diplomatic recognition is a matter of both politics\nand paperwork, and the lack of recognition can isolate a state and/or its citizens.\n\u2022Treaties manage cooperation and constraint. A set of cross-border compacts at-\ntempt to govern interstate interaction and limit abuses, promising things like hu-\nman rights and freedom of movement \u2014 declarations that are frequently \ufb02outed.\n\u2022Pax Americana. Finally, while it was not always so, the guarantor of the cur-\nrent nation state system is the USA, which is where the UN is headquartered,\nand which purports to \u201cprovide global leadership\u201d and \u201cchampion the rules-based\ninternational order.\u201d All other states must hope that this guarantor of the rules-\nbased order doesn\u2019t decide to invade, surveil, sanction, strafe, or otherwise desta-\nbilize them.\nThese cover the six essential parts of the state: borders, population, central govern-\nment, international sovereignty, diplomatic recognition, and the domestic monopoly on\nviolence.", "num_tokens": 1448}, "136": {"document": "5.2.3 The Nation State as a Term\nUnderstanding the term \u201cnation state\u201d requires us to distinguish the nation (a group\nof people with common descent, history, culture, or language) from the state (their\ngovernment).

The second word ( state) refers\nto the entity that governs these people, that commands the police and the military, and\nthat holds the monopoly of violence over the geographic area that the nation inhabits.\nIn a sense, the nation and the state are as di\ufb00erent as labor and management in a\nfactory. The former are the masses and the latter are the elite.\nThe textbook nation state is something like Japan, in which a single group with shared\nancestry and culture (the Japanese) occupies a clearly delineated territory (the islands\nof Japan) and is ruled by a clear sovereign (the Japanese government) which is repre-\nsentative of the people in some sense (originally via the divine, contemporaneously via\nthe Diet).", "num_tokens": 308}, "137": {"document": "5.2.4 Micronations and Multinations\nThis gives us a new perspective on why micronations like Sealand don\u2019t work: they\nstart backwards, from the territory and the government, rather than working forwards\nfrom a people and their culture.

How-\never, while this kind of terminology is not exactly deprecated , it\u2019s a bit old-fashioned.\nIt\u2019s not how we tend to talk about nation states in the current year.5.2. ON NATION STATES 205\nFirst, today we often discuss multiethnic states \u2014 multinations, like the USA \u2014 which\nare really more like the empires of yore than a classical monoethnic nation state. Sec-\nond, many contend that physical borders don\u2019t matter in the age of the internet. Third,\nmodern discourse focuses to a much greater extent on proposition nations , where shared\nideas are the organizing principle rather than shared inheritance. Fourth, and most\nimportantly, con\ufb02ict between ethnic groups within states can result in civil war, mass\ndeportation, totalitarian brainwashing, ethnic cleansing, forced conversion, and cul-\ntural destruction, the kind of process that recently resulted in the formations of East\nTimor and South Sudan.\nLater, we\u2019ll talk about how network states address these issues, but these are the (un-\nderstandable!) reasons why the distinction between the nationand thestatehas fallen\nout of favor. Scholars don\u2019t want to inadvertently encourage separatism or irredentism\nor worse, lest people think it\u2019s not a realnation state unless the political entity (the\nstate) represents all the members of a single ethnicity (the nation) in all the lands\naround the world where they preponderate.\nOr at least, they don\u2019t want to do so domestically. Because the average American is\na bit schizophrenic when it comes to terminology like this. He can easily understand\nthe desire of, say, the Ukrainian people to break free of the Russian empire, or for the\nTibetan nation to have their own government separate from the Chinese state, or for\nthe Persian people to distinguish themselves from the theocracy of Iran. But the same\nperson is typically more skeptical that Britain should have exited the European Union,\nlet alone that the \u201cTexan nation\u201d should have its own sovereign state.\nThecynicalmightsaythatnationalaspirationsgetairtimeinproportiontothenational\ninterest; themorecynicalmightsaythateventheterm\u201cnationalinterest\u201d isyetanother\nmisnomer, because it\u2019s more like the \u201cstate\u2019s interest\u201d given that the American state\nrules more than one nation. This, however, leads us to the key question of what exactly\nconstitutes a nation.", "num_tokens": 617}, "139": {"document": "5.2.6 What is a Nation?\nThis question was once all-important: what groups are signi\ufb01cant enough to be called\nnations, candidates for a state of their own?

But which\nof these groups should be considered a \u201cnation\u201d?\nA De\ufb01nitional Approach\nLet\u2019s start with Oxford\u2019s de\ufb01nition by way of their free service Lexico:\nA large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or\nlanguage, inhabiting a particular country or territory.206 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nFrom that de\ufb01nition, we can extract the following properties:\n\u2022A large body of people : has to be of a substantial size (10-100k+?)\n\u2022united: members see themselves as being part of the same group.\n\u2022common descent : shared genetics, have intermarried more with each other than\npeople outside the nation.\n\u2022(or) history : shared past, have lived near each other for some time.\n\u2022(or) culture : shared dress, food, mannerisms, religion, and/or customs.\n\u2022(or) language : shared spoken and/or written tongue.\n\u2022inhabiting a particular...territory : found in a speci\ufb01c region of the globe.\nEach of these pieces can be poked at. How large is \u201clarge\u201d? How do we measure whether\na group of people is united? How localized to a particular territory does a nation have\nto be, or can it be nomadic? And why do we have a complex \u201cOR\u201d statement buried\nin the middle, where common descent, history, culture, orlanguage all \ufb01gure in? Our\n\ufb01rst instinct is that the de\ufb01nition of a nation is a little fuzzy, and our instinct is right.\nAn Empirical Approach\nTo ground our discussion, let\u2019s go through speci\ufb01c examples of groups that have been\ncalled nations:\n\u2022The Japanese : They line up with the de\ufb01nition perfectly. The Japanese at one\npoint did have quite an empire, and there is a Japanese diaspora in the US\n(and Brazil)...but most people of Japanese ancestry live on the islands of Japan,\nspeak the Japanese language, are governed by the Japanese state, and live in an\nessentially monoethnic polity.\n\u2022The Spanish : They have a nation state today, but in the past they had an\ninternational empire that then contracted, leaving them mostly to themselves\non the Iberian Peninsula. They left behind a global footprint in the form of 20\ncountries that speak Spanish, yet do not consider themselves part of the Spanish\nnation state.\n\u2022The Turks : They are a multiethnic state today that is also the successor to an\neven larger empire, the Ottoman Empire, with a de\ufb01nitionally Byzantine history.\n\u2022The Israelis : Theirstatusasanationstatechangedwithtime. TheJewishpeople\nwere once a stateless nation, a diasporic group united by common ancestry and\ntradition without a land or government to call their own. Then, within living\nmemory, they founded the state of Israel. (Herzl\u2019s work is a major inspiration for\nthis book.)\n\u2022The Catalonians, the Kurds, and the Palestinians : Of course, for every Spain,\nIsrael, or Turkey, there is a Catalonia, a Palestine, a Kurdistan \u2014 namely a group5.2. ON NATION STATES 207\nthat self-identi\ufb01es as a nation and feels its national aspirations have been denied.\nThese are stateless nations , as distinct from nation states, without necessarily\nendorsing any particular cause.\n\u2022The Irish : They now have an independent Ireland, but famously didn\u2019t for many\nyears under the British. A controversial issue is whether Northern Ireland should\nbe part of the Republic of Ireland, or part of the UK.\n\u2022The Taiwanese : This group is recognized as a nation by some parties but by no\nmeans all. We can think of these as partially sovereign nations , with a measure\nof control over their own state and territory, but less than they\u2019d like.\n\u2022The Americans, the Singaporeans, and the French : These states have tried, with\nvarying success, to craft a common identity as a \u201cnation\u201d from the raw material of\nseveral di\ufb00erent ethnic groups. Indeed, the Americans have, by some measures,\nbeen very successful in this e\ufb00ort \u2014 at least for a time. The Americans, the\nSingaporeans, and the French are explicitly proposition nations.\n\u2022The Chinese and the Indians : These gigastates are not really single-nation states\ngiven the sheer multiplicity of di\ufb00erent groups within each country\u2019s borders.\nHowever, those di\ufb00erent groups didn\u2019t all recently arrive next to each other like a\nBurningManencampment. They\u2019vebeenlivingalongsideeachotherforcenturies\nin a common civilization, with greater and lesser levels of past uni\ufb01cation, so\nthe grouping is more \u201cLindy\u201d than more recent multiethnic states with less of a\nlong-term track record, let alone the wholly arbitrary states left in the wake of\ncolonialism. Some have used the term civilization state for these entities. You\nmight even stretch this to encompass the European Union, though it is more of a\ntransnational bureaucracy than an entity that celebrates European civilization.\nAnd for many Middle Eastern and African countries, the states don\u2019t really re\ufb02ect the\nunderlying nations at all. A clue here is the presence of horizontal or vertical lines\non a map, lines that don\u2019t re\ufb02ect the organic physical (deserts, mountains, rivers) and\ncultural (languages, marriages, religions) barriers that help de\ufb01ne nations. Many of\nthese \u201cimposed states\u201d are a parting gift from colonial empires.\nFrom these examples, we can already see quite a bit of variation:\n\u2022nationswithstates (Japanese, Spanish)\n\u2022nationswithoutstates (Kurds, Catalonians)\n\u2022nations with partially sovereign states (Taiwan)\n\u2022multiethnic states that are trying to create proposition nations (America, Singa-\npore, France)\n\u2022imposedmultiethnicstatesthatdon\u2019tevenhaveapropositiontobindthem(many\n\u201cstates\u201d formed as shotgun marriages in the aftermath of European colonialism)208 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\n\u2022civilization states that are multiethnic, but have long-standing cultural ties that\nunify their constituent nations (China, India)\nJust by touring this topic, we also see that the issue of \u201cwhat is a nation\u201d is still the hot\nbutton, the third rail, the pulse raiser, the argument starter. Because a nation granted\nlegitimacy can claim territory and erect a polity, while a nation denied recognition\nremains landless and stateless, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher for this seemingly abstract\nquestion.\nA Philosophical Approach\nWe just did some speci\ufb01c examples. Can we enunciate general principles that de\ufb01ne\nwhich groups should be considered bona \ufb01de nations? Many scholars from the past to\nthe recent present have taken a crack at this question.\nHere\u2019sanecessarilyincompletepr\u00e9cisoftheirviews,takeninpartfromBenner\u2019schapter\nhere and Kaufmann\u2019s review here. First, the thinkers of the late 1700s and 1800s,\nwriting during the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, or the Revolutions of\n1848:\n\u2022Rousseau : if a group of people voluntarily consents to being bound by the same\ngoverning authority, they are a nation.\n\u2022Marx: a nation is a convenient group supported by a Great Power to destabilize\na rival. Regarding communism, the nation is a group to lead to acquire political\nsupremacy and a boundary to transcend to unite the proletariat.\n\u2022Locke: if two groups lay claim to the same territory, the more \u201crational and\nindustrious\u201d should be considered a nation.\n\u2022John Stuart Mill : if a group consents to the same governing authority, and is\ncapable of attaining control over a piece of land, they should be considered a\nnation. Mill\u2019s concept of utility, however, trumps consent.\n\u2022Hegel: a nation is formed by its institutions imbuing a sense of shared ethics.\nWar tests that ethical duty and is not inherently evil, but a natural condition of\nanarchic interstate relations.\n\u2022JG Herder", "num_tokens": 1994}, "140": {"document": ": If a group shares language and descent, it is a nation, a concept\nknown as primordialism. Moreover, small nations should be independent from\nlarger nations that want to assimilate them into di\ufb00erent languages.\n\u2022JG Fichte : likeHerder, separatelanguagesandethnicitiesde\ufb01neseparatenations.\nMoreover, a state can build a nation through education, guiding the populace\ntowards a shared cultural and linguistic identity.\n\u2022Ernest Renan : a nation is those with \u201ccommon glories\u201d and sacri\ufb01ces in the\npast and \u201cthe will to continue them in the present.\u201d The existence of a nation5.2. ON NATION STATES 209\nis represented by a \u201cdaily plebiscite\u201d that constitutes the present consent of a\npeople.\n\u2022Ernest Gellner : nations are peoples sharing (via schooling) language, culture,\nand forms of communication particularly adapted to modern society.\n\u2022Benedict Anderson : nations are just social constructs, imagined communities,\nbased on linguistic connections driven by \u201cprint capitalism.\u201d\n\u2022Eric Hobsbawm : nations must have a historic association with a current state,\na long-established linguocultural administrative elite, and a proven capacity for\nconquest.\nThese de\ufb01nitions both overlap and con\ufb02ict. Some tensions include:\n\u2022Primordialism vs propositionism. A nation can be a group with shared ancestry,\nculture, and language, but it can also be based purely on ideas and voluntary\nassociation.\n\u2022Scale vs uniqueness. A nation needs su\ufb03cient scale to be able to defend itself, so\nit should adopt a broad de\ufb01nition of national membership. But it needs to also\navoid becoming so assimilated into a large-scale group that there\u2019s no distinct\nculture to defend.\n\u2022Self-determination vs external sponsorship. A nation is based in part on self-\nidenti\ufb01cation as a nation, but in practice needs to also be capable of delivering\nreal world results (being \u201crational and industrious\u201d) and of attracting the support\nof a Great Power patron.\n\u2022Imagined communities vs real linguocultural ties. A nation is an imagined com-\nmunity and a social construct, but it needs to share enough of the same language\nand culture to feasibly assemble that construct.\nThese divergences mean there isn\u2019t yet a single test for whether a group is a nation,\nthough one can make a more or less persuasive case in any given instance by appealing\nto di\ufb00erent standards. However, with modern tools, we might be able to tidy up that\nfuzziness. Later in this chapter, we\u2019ll introduce a computational approach to de\ufb01ning\na nation that complements the empirical and philosophical approaches.

FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nThe De\ufb01nitional Approach\nThis helpful video enumerates six properties of a state:\n1.Border: a clearly de\ufb01ned territory\n2.Population : one or more nations that live within that territory\n3.Central government : the ability to create laws\n4.Interstate sovereignty : in theory, control over domestic a\ufb00airs without interfer-\nence by other states\n5.Recognition : diplomatic recognition by other states\n6.Domestic monopoly on violence : the ability to maintain order inside the territory\nA failed state in the midst of civil war wouldn\u2019t \ufb01t, for example, because it wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to prevent foreign powers from interfering (item 4), nor would it be able to\ncontrol violence domestically (item 6). A micronation doesn\u2019t count because it lacks\nterritory (item 1) and population (item 2). And an administrative subdivision of the\nUS like Arkansas also wouldn\u2019t count, because it lacks recognition by foreign states\n(item 5) and control relative to Washington, D.C. (item 3). However, a subdivision\ncan sometimes becomean independent state.\nThe Comparative Approach\nHow about a comparison? Precisely because they\u2019re so often con\ufb02ated, it\u2019s worth\naddressing in detail just how a state di\ufb00ers from a nation.\n\u2022The state is a political and legal entity, while a nation is a cultural, ethnic, and\npsychological identity.\n\u2022The state is bound by laws and threat of force, while a nation is bound by\nsentiments and linguistic/genetic/cultural alignment.\n\u2022The state is top-down and hierarchical, while the nation is bottom-up and peer-\nto-peer.\n\u2022And, as above, the state has a \ufb01xed territory, a government and sovereignty over\na territory, while a nation typically has shared language, culture, and/or ancestry.\nNations may not always have a single state. The Kurds lack a state, while the Koreans\nare split into two states. Conversely, states may govern one or more nations. The\nBritish state governs the English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish nations, while the Soviet\nstate governed more than 100 di\ufb00erent nationalities.\nWhile some contend that the distinction between nation and state is an intrinsically\nEuropean idea, there are actually di\ufb00erent words for these concepts across languages.5.2. ON NATION STATES 211\nThe Pragmatic Approach\nPerhaps the simplest test for whether something is a bona \ufb01de state is whether it\u2019s a\nmember of the United Nations General Assembly. Does it have su\ufb03cient diplomatic\nrecognition? Is it considered a state by other entities we\u2019d consider states? In a word,\nis itrecognized ? This is important because even the very largest groups of people, like\nthe Chinese and the Indians, are outnumbered by the rest of the world; social viability\nis necessary for state viability.\nA couple of excellent books on this topic are Invisible Countries andNot on the\nMap, which review edge cases like Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, Transnistria, North-\nern Cyprus, Somaliland, South Ossetia, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic,\nKosovo, and Taiwan. Each of these entities has a greater or lesser degree of internal\nstate-like-ness, with Taiwan being the most legit, but all of them lack some degree of\nfull interstate recognition \u2014 often due to a powerful regional or global opponent.\nWhile we\u2019re discussing the UN, a better name than the \u201cUnited Nations\u201d might be\nthe \u201cSelected States.\u201d After all, many stateless nations don\u2019t have a seat in the United\nNationsGeneralAssembly, liketheKurds, theCatalonians, ortheTibetans. Andmany\ncountries that dohave seats are more akin to multinational empires than single-nation\nstates.\nThe Philosophical Approach\nKeynes said \u201cPractical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any in-\ntellectual in\ufb02uences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\u201d Meaning, if\nyou don\u2019t know what intellectual software you\u2019re running, you\u2019re probably running it\nunconsciously. So, it\u2019s hard to survey the many thinkers that led to the modern state,\nbecause we don\u2019t always understand the full scope of their impact.\nWe\u2019ll try anyway. Here\u2019s another necessarily imprecise set of summaries of what dif-\nferent political theorists thought about the state.\n\u2022Plato: the state should make possible the conditions under which everyone can\nprovide for themselves and seek the Good.\n\u2022Aristotle: all communities aim at some good, and the state is the highest kind of\ncommunity, aiming at the highest of goods.\n\u2022Locke: The state is legitimate if it enforces contracts and acts as the guarantor\nof private property.\n\u2022Carlyle: The state should be run by a hero that provides order.\n\u2022Schmitt: The state embodies a clear friend-enemy distinction.\n\u2022Marx: The state is meant to organize the proletariat against the ruling class.\n\u2022Keynes: The state should intervene to smooth the business cycle and support full\nemployment.212 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\n\u2022Rawls: The state distributes social goods and economic opportunities equally to\nits free citizens according to the theory of justice as fairness.\n\u2022Hobbes: The state possess absolute authority, and this powerful Leviathan makes\nanti-social men behave in pro-social ways.\n\u2022Rousseau : The state is legitimate if people have consented to a \u201cSocial Contract\u201d\nin which they self-rule and ideally do not abdicate sovereignty to potentially\ndisaligned representatives.\n\u2022Samuelson : The state is meant to provide public goods that private actors would\nnot be able to supply.\n\u2022Lee Kuan Yew : The state should provide its people with the maximum enjoyment\nof freedoms and respect the family unit. The state should embrace multiple\nnations yet demand loyalty.\nStatecraft Strategies and Programming Paradigms\nAgain, this isn\u2019t just desiccated theory. It\u2019s important to understand these ideas be-\ncause they are used implicitly or explicitly by the founders and leaders of actually\nexisting states.\nFrom a computer science standpoint, these schools of thought are statecraft strategies\nthat are analogous to programming paradigms. That is, you can often solve the same\nproblem from (say) an object-oriented, functional, or imperative standpoint. But cer-\ntain problems are easier to tackle with a particular paradigm, while others become\nmuch harder.\nSo too for these varying theories of the state. Moreover, rather than being used in\nisolation, these statecraft strategies are often fused within a single legal codebase, much\nas di\ufb00erent programming paradigms can complement each other within a company\u2019s\ncodebase.\nFor example, Karl Marx\u2019s zero-sum worldview made it easy to justify a Soviet state\nwithamassiveRedArmytodestroythecapitalistoppressors. Jean-JacquesRousseau\u2019s\nwritingbycontrastdidn\u2019tgivemuchjusti\ufb01cationfortheuseofforceitself, butfurnished\na vision of consensual communistic utopia that sat just on the other side of the Red\nArmy\u2019s liberating violence. Carl Schmitt and Thomas Carlyle are a roughly equivalent\npairing on the right, with Schmitt advocating that a hero use state force against the\nenemy and Carlyle talking up the bounteous order that would arise as a result.\nMarx and Rousseau\u2019s failure mode was their departure from economic reality, as they\ndidn\u2019t take into account self-interest. Schmitt and Carlyle\u2019s failure mode was their\ndeparture from political reality, as they didn\u2019t take into account the interests of the\nother guy. But their statecraft strategies were once in\ufb02uential enough to drive some\nof the most powerful states in world history, so we need to understand them, even if\nwe must also discard them. Think about how PHP is a programming language that5.2.

That may seem trivial, but later in this chapter we\u2019ll explore physically\ndecentralized polities in the context of network states.", "num_tokens": 475}, "144": {"document": "5.2.9 How were Modern Nation States Founded?\nThere are a few di\ufb00erent angles on the question of how nation states get founded.\nThe Historical Angle\nThe \ufb01rst angle is to think about when many states were founded on roughly the same\nprinciples at the same time. We can de\ufb01ne a few critical moments in history.\n\u2022WW2 and Cold War (1945-1991) : today\u2019s states were founded under the aegis\nof the postwar order. After World War II, within Europe large-scale population\ntransfers created monoethnic states. Meanwhile, outside Europe, the colonies\nowned by Western European powers experienced \u201cdecolonization\u201d and then ar-\nguably \u201crecolonization\u201d by the USSR or USA respectively in the name of commu-\nnism or capitalism. Another clutch of independent states arose after the collapse\nof the USSR in 1991.\n\u2022American Revolution, French Revolution, Great Divergence (1776-1800s) : Writ-\ners like Benedict Anderson date the rise of European nationalism in its modern\nsense to the \u201cGreat Divergence\u201d of the early 1800s, after the French Revolution,\nwhich was in turn inspired by the American Revolution.\n\u202230 Years War, Spanish/Dutch War, and Peace of Westphalia (1618-1648) : The\nPeace of Westphalia ended the 30 Years War between Protestants and Catholics\nthat had been kicked o\ufb00 by the Reformation, and ushered in the concept of states\nwith bounded territorial sovereignty as opposed to the unbounded authority of\nthe Catholic Church.\n\u2022Rise of mapmaking and print capitalism (1500s) : The rise of mapmaking tech-\nnologies enabled the creation of accurate maps. We take this for granted today,\nbut without good maps there were no explicit borders beyond terrain, only grad-\nual diminishment of the power of one sovereign as its territory bled into that of\nanother.\n\u2022Ancient era. Civilization states like China and India date their origins back to\nantiquity, and can point to certain continuities of language, culture, and religious\npractice.\n\u2022Prehistory. Primordialists argue that the nations that underpin states predate\nwritten history, as their linguistic, genetic, and cultural bonds stretch back thou-\nsands of years. In other words, nations are naturally occurring phenomena, more5.2. ON NATION STATES 215\nlike the periodic table of the elements than a social construct, with boundaries\nthat are obvious in a Potterian sense. Any real modern nation state was in this\nsense founded millennia ago.\nImportantly, the whole world didn\u2019t get modern nation states at the same time. For\nexample, Westphalian sovereignty was initially established withinWestern Europe, but\nnot outside it. European nation states were supposed to honor each others\u2019 borders, in\nprinciple at least, so they went abroad to conquer other places.\nBut these junction points in history are still useful ways to think about the founding of\nnation states, with one or the other looming larger depending on whether one is more\nfocused on the \u201cnation,\u201d the \u201cstate,\u201d or the \u201cnation state\u201d combination.\nFrom a practical standpoint, clearly you can\u2019t found a civilization state like China or\nIndia without thousands of years of history. But you might be able to distill a new\n\u201cnation\u201d like the Mormons (est: 1830) from the mass of Americans, or alternatively\narchitect an impressive new nation state like \u201cE\u201d-stonia (est: 1991) from the same\nnation oppressed by the dreary Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nThe Patronage Angle\nAn alternative approach is to look at the details of how speci\ufb01c nation states were\nfounded. One thing that pops out to us when studying enough of these histories is that\nnational independence is not solely a matter of self-determination, because the fate of\nmany nations is not determined wholly by their own e\ufb00orts.\nFor example, the Soviets were \u201canti-imperialist\u201d when that meant getting Western-\nsympathetic capitalists out, and Soviet-sympathetic communists in. The French sup-\nported the \ufb02edgling American nation when that meant poking a thumb in the eye of\ntheir British rivals. And today\u2019s Americans haven\u2019t been too vocal on the Kurds or\nYemenis given their alliances with the Turkish and Saudi states, but are extremely\nenthusiastic about the Ukrainians, Taiwanese, and Uighurs given their con\ufb02icts with\nthe Russian and Chinese states.\nAs such, to achieve its ambitions a stateless nation may also need a patron, a kind of\nventure capitalist Great Power. Self-determination is not enough.\nThe Military Angle\nMany countries were founded within living memory, but because they were often\nfounded by force, some don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible to found new countries withoutforce.\nOr is it? They say you cannot found a Pentagon; they don\u2019tsay you can\u2019t found a\ncompetitor to the post o\ufb03ce, or the taxi medallion system, or to NASA. They instead\ngo right to the thing where we don\u2019t have comparably recent foundings...or do we?\nAfter all, the Pentagon itself was built by human beings just like you and me in 1943.\nIndia, Israel, and Singapore were likewise founded in 1947, 1948, and 1965 respectively,\nand have their own defense department equivalents.216 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nOf course, there are other interpretations of this challenge. It could mean \u201cOK, it\nhappenedawhileago, butIdon\u2019tthinkthePentagon-formingprocesscanberepeated,\u201d\norperhaps\u201cItwouldbebadtoraiseamassivenewarmy,asthatwouldbedestabilizing,\u201d\nor even, \u201cCome on, you can\u2019t found the most powerful military in the world from\nscratch.\u201d But answering these kinds of questions presents an embedded Catch-22.\nEither someone thinking about starting new countries must want to create a powerful\nnew military (dangerous!) or else they don\u2019t have any guns and will get crushed by\nthose that do (dangerously naive).\nOne answer is that you don\u2019t need to get full sovereignty but can instead contract\nwith an existing sovereign for defense. In fact, this is that this is actually what most\n\u201creal\u201d countries already do \u2014 few truly have full sovereignty, as most contract out their\ndefense in a similar manner way to the US or (nowadays) China.\nAnother answer is that you could write a book just on this (and perhaps we\u2019ll need to\nadd another chapter), but for a fundamentally digital entity with physical decentral-\nization around the world, the primary mode will be nonviolent digital defense through\nsecrecy, pseudonymity, decentralization, and encryption.

In Europe, the populace\ndidn\u2019t think of themselves as all being primarily \u201cFrench\u201d or \u201cGerman\u201d till much later\non. They instead thought of themselves on the basis of their feudal lord or region\n(Brittany, Prussia) or religion ( e.g., Protestant/Catholic). Transnational entities like\nthe Catholic Church also claimed dominion over all believers, no matter where they\nmight be, so there was a question as to whether Pope or King had ultimate authority\nin any given jurisdiction. Wars ensued.\nThe Peace of Westphalia in 1648 resolved these issues and is considered by many to\nbe the origin of the European nation state. The Westphalian peace divided territory\nby lines on a map. Over each territory thus delineated, there was a government that\nrepresented the people in that territory, with the right to exercise force on their behalf.\nAnd these \u201csovereign\u201d states were supposed to leave each other alone.\nIn theory, the state was meant to be an innovation in violence reduction. You stay\nin your lane, I stay in mine. Clear sovereigns would keep domestic order, and the\nprinciple of national sovereignty would deter aggression from abroad. It didn\u2019t entirely\nwork out like that, of course; both intrastate and interstate con\ufb02ict still occurred.

By trade and opening of markets. This is not always peaceful: see\nthe British East India Company, Smedley Butler, and the Opium Wars.\n\u2022Ideologically. By education and conversion. Revolutionary France invested heav-\nily in educating all citizens to speak French, expanding the self-identi\ufb01ed French\nnation. Similarly, Christian, Muslim, and Communist groups spent immense ef-\nfort on evangelism. Of course, while some of this evangelism grows the support\nbase of a nation state (like Maoism did for the PRC and arguably Wahhabism\ndid for Saudi Arabia), other kinds of viral ideas cut across the boundaries of state\nand nation alike in destabilizing ways.", "num_tokens": 317}, "147": {"document": "5.2.12 How did States In\ufb02uence Nations, and Vice Versa?\nNation state formation is bidirectional; nations create states which in\ufb02uence nations,\nand so on. While a nation must come \ufb01rst, many of history\u2019s most successful nation\nstates drew adjacent (and then non-adjacent) people into the founding population by\nmeans ranging from cultural appeal to rape and pillage.\nPrior to Garibaldi, only about 2.5% of \u201cItalians\u201d spoke what we now know as Ital-\nian, but what was then the Florentine dialect of Italian. Similarly, before the French\nRevolution, less than 50% of France spoke today\u2019s o\ufb03cial variety of French. And un-\ntil Bismarck\u2019s uni\ufb01cation of Germany, there was rivalry between Prussia and Austria\n(\u201cGerman dualism\u201d) for exactly how and whether a \u201cGermany\u201d should be formed.\nA related phenomenon is the feedback loop between political borders and national\nculture. The 38th parallel didn\u2019t have pre-existing historical signi\ufb01cance in Korean\nculture, but after the Korean War the rate of intermarriage between the new \u201cNorth\nKorean\u201d and \u201cSouth Korean\u201d groups plummeted. This state of a\ufb00airs has persisted for\n70 years; the longer it continues, the larger the cultural gap between the two groups.\nHard political boundaries of this kind serve much the same purpose as natural physical\nboundaries in the past like rivers, mountains, and deserts. They impede allelic and\ncultural di\ufb00usion, and thus contribute to nation-forming dynamics.

But you can\u2019t get diplomatic recognition for a made-up country right\no\ufb00 the bat, so you can\u2019t found a network state directly.\nInstead, you found a startup society and hope to scale it into a network state that\nachieves diplomatic recognition from a pre-existing government, just as you don\u2019t found\napubliccompany directly, butinsteadfoundastartupcompanyandhopetoscaleitinto\na public company that achieves \u201cdiplomatic recognition\u201d from a pre-existing exchange\nlike the NASDAQ.\nMoreover, to extend the analogy, the process of scaling a startup involves waypoints -\nlike \u201cseed startup,\u201d \u201cseries B startup,\u201d and \u201cunicorn\u201d - prior to achieving the status of a5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 221\npublic company. So too there are at least two waypoints between startup society and\nnetwork state worth noting: the network union and the network archipelago.\nTurning a startup society into a network union makes it a digital community capable of\ncollectiveaction. Turningthatnetworkunionintoanetworkarchipelagomanifeststhat\ncollective action in the real world, as the community crowdfunds physical properties\naround the world and connects them via the internet. Finally, an impressive enough\nnetwork archipelago can achieve diplomatic recognition from an existing government,\nthereby becoming a true network state.\nThe De\ufb01nition\nThat\u2019s the process of getting to a network state. Now let\u2019s drill into each part of our\nproposed de\ufb01nition.\n\u2022A social network. The people of a network state form their nation online. Social\nrather than geographic proximity is the core organizing principle. But this isn\u2019t\na typical social network like Facebook or Twitter; it\u2019s what we call a 1-network\nwhere there is just onecoherent community present, rather than many separate\ncommunitiesasonFacebookorTwitter. It\u2019snotquiteacompletegraph-everyone\ndoesn\u2019t have to be friends with every single other node - but it\u2019s much closer to\nthat than a typical social network.\nAdmission to this social network is selective, people can lose their account privi-\nleges for bad behavior, and everyone who\u2019s there has explicitly opted in by apply-\ning to join. That application process could involve public proof of alignment via\nwriting, a career history that demonstrates common values, or the investment of\ntime and energy into the society to obtain digital assets. Joining the network that\nunderpins a network state is nota purely economic proposition, not something\nthat can be bought with money alone. It\u2019s a concrete version of Rousseau\u2019s social\ncontract as a literal smart contract, one that all sign before entering, a way to\nturn an abstract proposition into an actual nation.\n\u2022A moral innovation. A network state grows out of a startup society that is\npremised on a moral innovation, where everyone within the society thinks some\nprinciple X is good that the rest of the world thinks is bad, or vice versa. This is\nthe proposition part of a proposition nation. For example, the moral innovation\ncould be as trivial-seeming as \u201csugar bad\u201d or \u201c24/7 internet bad\u201d, or as heavy-\nweight as \u201cthis traditional religion is good\u201d. The moral innovation draws people\nin. It gives a reason for the society to exist, a purpose that\u2019s distinct from the\noutside world, a universalist complement to the particularist sense of national\nconsciousness, an ideological mission that others will nod their heads at even if\nthey don\u2019t share (\u201cok, I understand why someone might want a sugar-free society,\nor a Benedict Option community\u201d).\nThe reason we put such a high priority on a moral innovation is that missionary\nsocieties outcompete mercenary ones, not just in theory but in practice. For222 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nexample, the historian Paul Johnson once pointed out that the for-pro\ufb01t colonies\nin America failed but the religious ones had the cohesion and commitment to\nmake it through the brutal winters (see 11:00 here). We discuss this at length in\nthe chapter on the One Commandment.\n\u2022A sense of national consciousness. Everyone in a network state feels like they\u2019re\npart of the same community, sharing the same values and culture. They\u2019re a\nnation in the sense of Renan...\u201cto have done great things together, to want to do\nmore.\u201d Again, it\u2019s much more like a complete graph than a typical social network,\nas almost every node is friendly with a very large fraction of other nodes.\n\u2022A recognized founder. A state, like a company, needs a leader. Especially early\non. But truly strong leadership comes from consent and buy-in, not propaganda\nor force. Hence, it\u2019s important to have a recognized founder, one that people\nactually listen to and choose to follow by joining the community.\nCan that founder break up the Triforce, splitting their authority into some kind\nof multisig? Sure, just like the founder of a startup company can choose to give\nup board seats. But it\u2019s easy to give away power and hard to consolidate it,\nand you need that power sometimes to make hard but important non-consensus\ndecisions.That\u2019s why dual-class stock to maintain control is used by both the\nUS establishment and their opponents.\nAs with giving up corporate board seats, giving up some power may be the right\nthing to do at some point for the network state founder. But in the event that\na network state degenerates into a bureaucracy - as many mature organizations\ndo - a key part of the network state model is that it is, like the startup model,\nbuilt to always allow peaceful exit. Anyone can, at any time, leave to found a\nnew startup society and try scaling it into a network state.\n\u2022A capacity for collective action. This is tightly related to the concept of national\nconsciousness. It\u2019s a combination of collective purpose (which is like the mission\nstatement of a company, but for a community) and the capacity to acton that\npurpose.\nFirst, let\u2019s understand the idea of collective purpose through some examples. The\nPuritanswantedtobuilda\u201cCityonaHill.\u201d TheJapaneseaftertheMeijiRestora-\ntion replaced their previous mission statement of \u201cRevere the Emperor, Expel the\nBarbarians\u201d with \u201cEnrich the Country, Strengthen the Military,\u201d turning their\nsociety around 180 degrees and thereby building the \ufb01rst non-white industrialized\npower. And while the process of Indian Independence and Partition was messy\nbeyond belief, on the other side the collective purpose of independence uni\ufb01ed5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 223\nthe Indian nation in a way it never had been before, with hundreds of so-called\n\u201cprincely states\u201d and countless ethnic groups now integrated into a single India.\nAs one more example, JFK once focused the US on the common purpose of\n\u201cachieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon\nand returning him safely to the Earth.\u201d This was a collective purpose di\ufb00erent\nfrom but allied with the also-valid zero-sum goal of defeating communism. It was\nperhaps the penultimate great thing the US accomplished as a uni\ufb01ed country,\nwith the defeat of the Soviet Union as the last.\nThese collective purposes helped unify their respective nations. They may be\nimperfect, but once there\u2019s no collective purpose at all, people start wondering\nwho they are. \u201cWho are we?\u201d That directionlessness leads to what we see in\ntoday\u2019s US, split into two tribes whose only \u201ccollective purpose\u201d is to win a zero-\nsum game against the other - a game each thinks it must win before being able\nto move forward to the promised land.\nNext, supposing we have a collective purpose, what does collective action towards", "num_tokens": 1989}, "152": {"document": "that purpose look like? This is why the process of building a network state\nincludes a network union. From the very outset it organizes people to work\ntogether for the bene\ufb01t of their chosen community through the familiar interface\nof their screens. This, again, is quite di\ufb00erent from current \u201csocial\u201d networks\nlike Twitter, which give individual scores for likes and followers but no team\ndashboard, no way of setting and achieving tangible goals as a group.\n\u2022An in-person level of civility. In the 90s and 2000s it was attention-getting when\npeople were grossly incivil to each other online, as it was a funny contrast to the\ngenerally civil o\ufb04ine world. Now it\u2019s just old, and not funny anymore. Moreover,\ninternet ideologies have emerged that justifyrandom nastiness with slogans like\n\u201ccivility is tone policing\u201d or \u201ctoxicity is social defense.\u201d Yet a society where ev-\neryone is constantly disrespectful to everyone else doesn\u2019t seem like a progressive,\npublic-spirited society. And the conservative US of the 1950s managed to main-\ntain a strong level of self-defense becausethey were internally civil. So whether\none is coming from the left or right, pulling together a high-trust society means\nin-person levels of civility towards community fellow members, both o\ufb04ine and\nonline. High trust in turn comes from alignment towards a collective purpose and\na sense of national consciousness.\n\u2022An integrated cryptocurrency. This is the digital backbone of the network state.\nIt manages the internal digital assets, the smart contracts, the web3 citizen lo-\ngins, the birth and marriage certi\ufb01cates, the property registries, the public na-\ntional statistics, and essentially every other bureaucratic process that a nation\nstate manages via pieces of paper. Because it\u2019s protected by encryption, it can\ncoordinate all the functions of a state across the borders of legacy nation states.224 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\n\u2022An archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories. This is the physical footprint\nof the network state. Rather than buying territory in one place, or trying to\nnegotiate sovereignty up front, you build the community in the cloud and then\ncrowdfund physical real estate on the earth. That\u2019s o\ufb03ce space, yes, but also\nhomes and shops - just spread all around the world in clusters, rather than con-\ncentrated in one place. You network these clusters together using the internet\ninto a network archipelago, eventually using newer technologies to make them\nmore real. For example, you can make the \ufb02ag of a network state appear to\nanyone with augmented reality glasses and the right NFT, as per this visual.\nYou can also make doors open on command for community members, where their\nENS name is their login. The point is that a network state is nota purely digi-\ntal thing. It has a substantial physical component: all the buildings around the\nworld crowdfunded by its members.\n\u2022A consensual government limited by a social smart contract. Now we get to\nthe government. Many people make the mistake of thinking the laws (or the\nland) come \ufb01rst when starting a new state, but laws should only come after the\nformation of an organic people \u2013 of a network nation \u2013 not before. That\u2019s because\nlaws encode the implicit understanding of a people. Contra the concept that you\n\u201ccan\u2019t legislate morality\u201d, that\u2019s all you can do: set up laws that re\ufb02ect the moral\nconsensus of a people as to what is encouraged and discouraged, acceptable and\noptional, mandatory and forbidden.\nHow is that moral consensus arrived at? It could be through a 51% democracy\n(where 51% of people can outvote the other 49%) or it could be via a 100%\ndemocracy (where 100% of people have migrated into a system and can migrate\nout at any time), or it could be via one of the zillions of techniques for satisfying\npreferences described in the literature.\nThe speci\ufb01cs don\u2019t matter as much as the ethics. That is, what makes a govern-\nment legitimate is not process but substance.Given the consent of the governed,\nany form of government is internally legitimate. The question is then whether it\nwill be considered externally legitimate, whether the world at large will accept\nthis government - but that is an empirical question more than an ethical one.\nPut another way, if people can opt in to bungee jumping and skydiving, if eu-\nthanasia is legal, then experimenting with self-governmental systems that vary\ndramatically from the status quo should also be legal. Many of them won\u2019t work,\nbut many projects don\u2019t work either; that doesn\u2019t mean we stop people from\ntrying.\nOne way of thinking about this is that the typical Ford customer doesn\u2019t care\nabout how Ford\u2019s internal a\ufb00airs are managed. The buyer doesn\u2019t care whether5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 225\nFord is organized by product or by function, whether they\u2019re run top-down by the\nCEO or in a consultative way with the board, whether they pay market salaries\nor incentivize more heavily with stock. Ford could be a holocracy or a co-op.\nSo long as everyone has consented to be governed by the Ford CEO by signing\nan employee agreement, and can leave if that agreement is no longer congenial,\nFord\u2019s internal arrangements are ethical.\nThis logic works so long as you can opt out of Ford\u2019s ecosystem completely.\nHaveyoudriven a Ford, lately? It\u2019s trickier when it\u2019s something like Google,\nwhich is so powerful that it\u2019s hard for the non-Chinese portion of the planet to\nfully opt out of. Then you might want some kind of say in what goes on inside\nthe Googleplex. Still, most companies aren\u2019t Google. Setting aside the edge\ncase of \u201cinescapable global ubiquity\u201d for now, the ethical case for allowing opt-in\nexperiments in corporate governance is pretty strong, for taking a broad view of\nthe \u201cconsent of the governed.\u201d\nNow extend that idea to non-corporate governance, with coin governance as a\nproof point, and network states as an endpoint. Questions arise. How could\nconsent be given? How could others measure that consent was freely given?\nAnd what if someone wants to retract that consent, perhaps right before they\u2019re\nsubject to an act of governance they don\u2019t like?\nIn practice, we say that a user has consented to be governed by a startup society\nif he has signed a social smart contract that gives a system administrator limited\nprivilegesoverthatuser\u2019sdigitallifeinreturnforadmissiontothestartupsociety.\nThis portmanteau term combines Rousseau\u2019s concept of the \u201csocial contract\u201d with\nthe blockchain concept of the \u201csmart contract.\u201d\nSigning the social smart contract is very similar to depositing your funds with\na centralized exchange, or locking them up in a smart contract with admin keys\n\u2013 you\u2019re taking conscious risk with an on-chain asset in return for admission\nto a digital ecosystem. Now imagine using your ENSto \u201clog in\u201d to a startup\nsociety, thereby giving it limited privileges over your account in order to enter\nthat startup society.\nWhat does that log in entail? The simplest version of this is using your ENS\nto log into a startup society community. A more sophisticated version is using\nyour ENS to enter a part of the so-called \u201copen metaverse\u201d governed by a startup\nsociety. But the most interesting version is using your ENS to log into o\ufb04ine\nterritory owned by a startup society, as in the aforementioned example where an\nENS handshake opens a smart lock, or the one where it shows a glowing sigil.\nYou might also have to put down a deposit to physically enter a startup society\nmanaged territory.226 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nYou can extrapolate that ENS-login-to-physical-world example dramatically. As\nmore physical territories are crowdfunded by a startup society, and more smart\ndevices within those territories are owned by the society, it can exert consensual\ndigital governance within those territories on all who opted in by signing the\nsocialsmartcontract. Forexample, ifsomeonemisbehaveswithinagivenstartup-\nsociety-owned jurisdiction, after a Kleros-style digital trial, their deposits could\nbe frozen and their ENS locked out of all doors for a time period as a punishment.\nThis is at \ufb01rst blush similar to what\u2019s already happening in both the West and\nChina, where Canadian trucker funds are being frozen and WeChat QR codes are\nbeing used as instruments of digital control...but with one enormous di\ufb00erence,\nwhich is that if", "num_tokens": 1993}, "153": {"document": "we can build many di\ufb00erent startup societies to choose from,\nthenthere is much more practical consent of the governed, because there are\nmany startup societies to choose from with explicit social smart contracts.\nEssentially, the key insight is that \u201cgovernment\u201d is becoming synonymous with\ndigital government. In any US-establishment- controlled territory your Google\naccount will soon be frozen for crossing the US establishment. In any CCP-\ncontrolled territory your WeChat account can be frozen for crossing the CCP. But\nin any crypto-anarchic territory there may not be much in the way of functional\ndigital services at all. So if one wants modernity constrained by cryptography, the\nconcept of the \u201csocial smart contract\u201d is one way to achieve consensual, limited\ngovernment \u2013 to limit what a government can do by tightly limiting its access to\nyour digital identity and resources, much like you can control exactly how much\nyou deposit onto a centralized exchange.\nThat sounds good at \ufb01rst. Then it sounds bad. Because if governance is limited\nsolely to the digital realm, only to on-chain assets and smart locks, how does a\nstartup society deal with physical criminals? The short answer is that for a long\ntime, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it leaves that to the surrounding legacy society, much like a\ncentralized crypto exchange collaborates with traditional o\ufb04ine law enforcement.\nEventually, if and when that startup society becomes a network state \u2013 in the\nsense of achieving diplomatic recognition from a legacy sovereign \u2013 then it can\npotentially take on physical law enforcement duties.\nIn the meantime, physical law enforcement itself is gradually turning into some-\nthing done with autonomous robots - whether they be legged robodogs, rolling\ncameras, or \ufb02ying drones. So more law enforcement is being done from a com-\nmand line. And that trend gradually converges with the concept of digital law\nenforcement by a network state.\nTo summarize: when we say that a network state has \u201cconsensual government\nlimited by a social smart contract\u201d, we mean that it exercises authority over\na digital (and, eventually, physical) sphere constituted solely of those people\nwho\u2019ve opted in to its governance by signing a social smart contract with their\nENS names, in much the same way they might \u201copt in\u201d to the governance of a\ncentralized exchange by depositing coins there.5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 227\n\u2022A virtual capital. A network state is physically distributed, but its people still\ndigitally assemble in one place. That cloud assembly point could initially be\nsomething as modest as a Discord channel, but will eventually be a private sub-\nnetwork of the open metaverse. That means a virtual reality (VR) environment\nwith parts that can be seamlessly projected into the physical world with aug-\nmented reality (AR) glasses, so that you can see digital people, buildings, or\nobjects in the real world, like this. Access to a network state\u2019s virtual capital,\nlike everything else in a network state, is gated by web3 login limited to citizens.\nThe most ambitious version of this allows community members to gather online\nto create virtual architectural blueprints for new physical nodes of the network\nstate, as per this tweet. The reason this is feasible is that architecture is moving\nto VR. You could imagine a much higher resolution version of Minecraft that\ngets materialized into the physical world by a crowdfunded contractor (or by\ncommunity members with construction experience themselves). Think about the\nscene from Fight Club where the camera swivels around the room to show price\ntags on everything, and now imagine that in VR, with the cost to materialize\neach virtual structure in the physical world hovering above it.\n\u2022An on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real estate\nfootprint. A distributed society needs a distributed census. Unlike the US census,\nand more like Facebook\u2019s census of its userbase, a startup society\u2019s census can be\nconducted in real-time rather than every ten years. But a skeptical world won\u2019t\njust take those numbers on faith, given a \ufb02edgling startup society\u2019s incentive\nto overestimate them. They may trust the US government, or even Facebook\n(a public company) on its audited user numbers, but not some upstart startup\nsociety - not without some proof.\nBut how do you prove that a given startup society reallyhas 10,000 residents\nand one billion dollars in annual income and 10M square meters in its real es-\ntate footprint? Each of these elements can be established via on-chain data. We\nalready have techniques for proof-of-human, proof-of-income (via on-chain ac-\ncounting) and proof-of-real-estate (via blockchain real estate). We can get into\ntechnical detail on how you solve the \u201ccrypto oracle problem\u201d of getting o\ufb00-chain\ndata reliably onto the blockchain, but the short version is that you can use a sta-\ntistical estimator to take into account the fact that individual oracles may have\nerrors. By accumulating the censuses of all startup societies in a hypothetical\nnationrealestatepop.com site similar to coinmarketcap.com , you could track\nin realtime the number of startup society members, the acreage of real estate\nowned by those members, and their on-chain GDP.\n\u2022Attain a measure of diplomatic recognition. Now we come to the main event:228 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\ndiplomatic recognition. Diplomatic recognition by a pre-existing government is\nwhat distinguishes a network state from a startup society, just as \u201cdiplomatic\nrecognition\u201d by an exchange like the NASDAQ distinguishes a public company\nfrom a startup.\nDiplomatic recognition requires a putative state to have clout, and clout is in\nturn established by a publicly veri\ufb01able on-chain census of population, income,\nand real estate, to provethat your growing society is as large as you say it is.\nThat\u2019s why the aforementioned census is important.\nPutting all that together, we can see that the de\ufb01nition of a network state culminates\nin attaining diplomatic recognition from a pre-existing government, which requires far\nmore substance, leadership, physical presence, and long-term commitment than a typ-\nical online community, or even a cryptocurrency. It may be a LARP, but it\u2019s not done\non a lark.\nBreaking the De\ufb01nition\nYou can start to see why we have several parts to the de\ufb01nition. If you subtract one\npart you get something that doesn\u2019t quite match our intuition of what the next version\nof the nation state should be. Let\u2019s do that, subtracting each part just to see how it\nbreaks.\n\u2022No social network. If there\u2019s no social network, you have no digital pro\ufb01les,\nno messaging, no community fora, no mass media, and no easy way to recruit\nfrom the internet. You\u2019d essentially be living an Amish life, relying on pieces of\npaper or o\ufb04ine cues to determine who was part of your new state and how they\ninteracted. This isn\u2019t going to succeed the nation state.\n\u2022No recognized founder. With no recognized leader, you have no way of making\ncontentious decisions or setting the agenda.A founder is the best kind of leader,\nbecause they have the legitimacy associated with building an organization from\nscratch. Unlike a dictator, their authority isn\u2019t forcedupon the population, and\nanyone can exit at any time. And unlike a media oligarchy, a founder\u2019s authority\ndoesn\u2019t arise from propagandistic bombardment but from free choice.\n\u2022No sense of national consciousness. If there is no sense of national consciousness,\nthere is no nation underpinning the network state. It\u2019s just a bunch of random\npeople with nothing in common.\n\u2022No capacity for collective action. A group of people that lacks a capacity for\ncollective action - like most online communities, frankly - isn\u2019t going to get any-\nwhere.Even if they have national consciousness, without the capacity to orga-5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 229\nnize (which arises in part from a leader), they certainly can\u2019t build a state.\n\u2022No in-person level of civility. A group of people that constantly tears each other\ndown won\u2019t build an outhouse together, let alone a state. More deeply, the folks\nwho throw around slogans like \u201ccivility is tone policing\u201d or \u201ckill your heroes\u201d are\nactually engaged in endless status competition , because they have rejected the\ncurrent hierarchy but not yet accepted a new one. In a functioning, legitimate\nhierarchy (see diagram here) there\u2019s a mechanism for dispute resolution that\ndoesn\u2019t involve summoning a mob for every slight.\n\u2022No integrated cryptocurrency. After the \ufb01nancial deplatforming of Western proles\nand foreign elites, of Canadian truckers and 145M Russians, it\u2019s clear that digital", "num_tokens": 1998}, "154": {"document": "\ufb01nance is a weapon of war. So without a sovereign digital currency (and, more\ngenerally, a sovereign system of record) there is no sovereignty.\n\u2022No archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories. You can do many things\nonline, but not everything. Without physical territory you can\u2019t build FDA-\nfree zones, or NRC-free areas, or the Keto Kosher community, or many kinds\nof substantive parallel societies. You also can\u2019t meet, mate, mingle, and do all\nthe other things humans do in person. And most importantly you\u2019re not going\nto be taken seriously as a successor to the nation state without a large physical\nfootprint. The approach of knitting together crowdfunded physical territory into\na network archipelago addresses these issues.\n\u2022No virtual capital. Network states are not city states. City states were defeated\nby nation states for a reason: they are physically centralized and have limited\nscale. So particularist city states populated by small ethnic groups get rolled up\nby universalist nation states (or empires) with many ethnic groups.230 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nThat\u2019s the reason a network state has a virtual capital rather than a physical one.\nThink of it as \u201cremote-\ufb01rst,\u201d but for a society. In a remote company, nothing\no\ufb03cially exists unless it\u2019s online, in an internal system of record like GitHub.\nSimilarly, in a remote society, nothing o\ufb03cially exists unless it\u2019s on-chain, in the\nblockchain system of record for that society.\nPut another way: if you don\u2019t consciously set the capital of your network state\nto be virtual, it\u2019ll be physical. And if it\u2019s physical, the capital is centralized in\none place, and can get invaded by a nation state. But if it\u2019s instead a virtual\ncapital, with a backend that is encrypted and on-chain, then - in the fullness of\ntime - you can host an entire subset of the metaverse there, assuming blockspace\nincreases as bandwidth did.\n\u2022No on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real estate\nfootprint. The US Census is in the US Constitution for a reason; you need to\nknow something about your people to run a government. But for a network state,\nthe challenges are di\ufb00erent than those that faced the Founding Fathers.\nThe hard part isn\u2019t how to collectthe data; with modern technology it can be\nslurped up and dashboarded in real-time, rather than collected every ten years\non millions of pieces of paper. No, the hard part is getting people to believethe\ndata, given the huge incentives for faking the numbers.\nThat means establishing a cryptographically auditable information supply chain,\na transparent way of gathering the numbers for the network state census. That\nmeans showing the work so that people don\u2019t needto trust you, and can run the\ncomputation themselves.\nWhy is this important? Think again about the emergence of Bitcoin. Price was a\nsignal, asignalofstrength. Millionsoftradesacrossdozensofexchangesproduced\na signal that was reliable enough for companies and eventually governments to\nact upon. Price is why Bloomberg listed Bitcoin on a ticker in 2013. And price\nis why El Salvador recognized Bitcoin as a sovereign currency in 2021. We\u2019re not\ntalking about the short-term price here, which is and will be highly volatile, but\nthe long-term price - the secular trend.\nSimilarly, if people can check for themselves that there\u2019s a startup society that\nhas built itself into an network archipelago with 10M square meters of land, over5.3.

Many libertarians don\u2019t get the concept\nof diplomatic recognition, just like many progressives don\u2019t get the desirability of\nstarting new countries, so this point is worth discussing.\nWhat happens if you don\u2019t have diplomatic recognition? Then you aren\u2019t in the\nclub of legitimate states. That means any government can invade you at will,\nand the others will just shrug. It also means you don\u2019t have access to things like\nsovereign debt markets. You can\u2019t ink trade or passport deals. You likely can\u2019t\nbuy many goods and services that corporations or states sell only to other states,\nbecause you\u2019re not considered a legitimate government by the rest of the market.\nYou certainly can\u2019t write new regulations for your jurisdiction, because others do\nnot recognize your lawful authority over that jurisdiction, and can (again) invade\nyou at will.\nBasically, without diplomatic recognition, you aren\u2019t considered real. That\u2019s why\nmicronations don\u2019t work. They have no organic community, so they have no\nanswer to the question of \u201cyou and what army?\u201d And even more importantly, no\nanswer to the question of \u201cyou and what legitimacy?\u201d\nYou can think of diplomatic recognition by a pre-existing state as a \u201cnon-binding\ncommitment to not invade.\u201d Subsequent to recognition, the startup society now\ngains the ability to write laws governing the physical world in their patch of\nterritory without being invaded - at least by the recognizing state.This is why\nwerequirediplomatic recognition in the de\ufb01nition of a network state.\nThis gives you a sense of why each of the parts of the de\ufb01nition exist. A network state\nis at least as complex as a nation state, but the di\ufb00erence is that the latter already\nexists, so we take for granted how it works.\nWhat\u2019s next? Once the \ufb01rst diplomatic recognition comes, and the \ufb01rst true network\nstate arises, more will follow. That means we need to start thinking about the network\nstate system.232 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES", "num_tokens": 1349}, "155": {"document": "5.3.2 What is the Network State System?\nThe next step is to outline the assumptions of the network state system as a whole.\nRead this and compare it to those of the nation state system.\n\u2022Digital \ufb01rst. The digital network of the internet is primary.\n\u2022Composition . A network state is composed of a national network (the equivalent\nof the nation) and a governance network (the analog of the state). Unlike a\ntypical social network, a national network self-identi\ufb01es as a nation. Unlike a\ntypical social network company, a governance network is set up by that national\nnetwork as the legitimate government of that digital people.\n\u2022Terra incognita returns. The network state system assumes many pieces of the\ninternet will become invisible to other subnetworks. In particular, small network\nstates may adopt invisibility as a strategy; you can\u2019t hit what you can\u2019t see.\n\u2022Terra nullius returns. The network state system further assumes that unclaimed\ndigitalterritoryalwaysexistsintheformofnewdomainnames,cryptousernames,\nplotsoflandinthemetaverse, socialmediahandles, andaccountsonnewservices.\n\u2022Bottom-up migration of people. The network state system embraces the fuzzy\ndivisionoftheinternetintodi\ufb00erentsovereignsubnetworks. Itisaprobabilistic\ndigital division of peoplerather than a deterministic physical division\nofland.People migrate digitally and physically between network states; the\ncitizenry is as dynamic as the land of a nation state is static.\n\u2022N networks per citizen. Unlike the nation state system, where most people have\ncitizenship in only one state, in the network state system, every person can in\nprinciple be a member of more than one state, just as they can hold passports\nin more than one country, or be holders of more than one cryptocurrency, or be\nusers of more than one social network. Of course, they can spend most of their\ntime in one network state.\n\u2022Legitimacy from physical migration and digital choice. The power of network\nstates is constrained by consent and cryptography. First, recall that the gover-\nnance network of a given network state is the analog to the state of a traditional\ncountry. This governance network only has control over those digital citizens (ne-\ntizens) that have opted in, individually or collectively, to its governance, much as\none explicitly signs an employment contract when joining a company or implicitly\nsigns a social contract when stepping across a border. A given national network\ncan choose a governance network as an administrator, thereby forming (or join-\ning) a network state with an on-chain record of their collective decision. Or an\nindividual can join a network state on their own. Cryptography ensures that\nthis choice is demonstrably free and uncoerced, because no state can easily seize\nan individual\u2019s private keys. Cryptography further guarantees basic rights like\nfreedom of speech, free migration, private property, freedom of digital assembly\nand the like, so long as each user has exclusive access to their private keys.5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 233\n\u2022Decentralized administration. The group of people that administers a network\nstate, which we call a governance network, is composed of a founder/chief execu-\ntive and their engineers. They write laws in code to specify what is mandatory,\nencouraged, discouraged, and forbidden. These laws are interpreted by impar-\ntial servers and enforced by cryptography. In the network state system, each\nsocial subnetwork can choose which governance network administers them, as\ndetermined both by their physical location and where their digital property lies.\nOver time, this means polycentric law: people in a given physical area can switch\nbetween network states (and thus governance providers) just as they switch be-\ntween Uber and Lyft as taxi regulators, or Bitcoin and Ethereum as monetary\nregulators.\n\u2022Domestic monopoly of root access. Thegovernancenetworkofanetworkstatehas\nroot access to an administrative interface where law enforcement can \ufb02ip digital\nswitches as necessary to maintain or restore domestic order, just like the sysad-\nmins of today\u2019s tech companies. Of course, postulating the existence of such an\ninterface presupposes a world where everything from money to messaging, doors\nto dwellings, farms to factories, \ufb02ying drones to walking droids can be controlled\nfrom a single computer \u2014 but that world isn\u2019t far o\ufb00, and today there are few\nchecks on the digital power of the tech companies that are bringing it into being.\nThe network state system checks this power in two ways: by maintaining pri-\nvate keys (so foreign states and corporations cannot interfere in domestic a\ufb00airs)\nand by enabling exit (so citizens can execute \ufb01nancial and electoral votes of no\ncon\ufb01dence if need be, both as individuals and as groups).\n\u2022International sovereignty via cryptography. For a network state, sovereignty is\nprivate keys. If access to the aforementioned administrative interface is con-\ntrolled by private keys rather than a username/password combination, then the\nsame encryption techniques that make it di\ufb03cult for an outsider to seize an indi-\nvidual\u2019s private keys can make it di\ufb03cult for a foreign rival to steal a legitimate\ngovernment\u2019s private keys. This is a completely new way of defending sovereignty,\na complement and/or replacement for the military.\n\u2022Digital diplomatic recognition. Networkstatescanrecognizeeachotherbilaterally\n(similar to an API integration) or multilaterally ( e.g., by supporting the same\nblockchains). When people exit to other network states, whether digitally or\nphysically, they bring their most valuable possessions with them in the form of\nprivate keys. Some of these keys give access to property in global blockchains,\nothers give access to physical goods like cars and houses, and still others give\naccess to records hosted on state-run chains, like their netizen pro\ufb01le in the\nnetwork state they just left. Diplomatic recognition is then about interoperability\nand compatibility: are the \ufb01le formats and on-chain records used by one network\nstate honored by another?\n\u2022Chains manage cooperation and constraint. Public blockchains are the equivalent\nof international law in a network state system. They facilitate economic and234 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nsocial cooperation between network states and their netizens, but also constrain\nthose states with cryptographically binding code.\n\u2022Pax Bitcoinica. The ultimate guarantor of exit, and of the network state system\nat large, is Bitcoin. As cryptocurrency rises in strength, Bitcoin or something like\nit becomes a government of governments. It sits above every state and constrains\nit from printing in\ufb01nite quantities of money, from lawlessly seizing the funds of its\ncitizens, and from waging forever war. In doing so, it limits that which will never\nlimit itself. And even if the Bitcoin protocol speci\ufb01cally fails, or its cryptography\nhas a bug, the concept of cryptocurrency and the choice it represents will not\ndisappear from this earth.\nAssumption: Digital Primary, Physical Secondary\nOne point we touched on above, but that bears repeating, is that the network state\nsystem assumes the world has \ufb02ipped to digital \ufb01rst : all nontrivial human-created\nevents start in the cloud and then, if important, are \u201cprinted out\u201d into the physical\nworld.\nThink about anything a human does today: all o\ufb03ce work is online, as is much social-\nization. Courts are now online, as are politicians. So is money. So is agriculture, and\nmanufacturing, and shipping. The phone has indeed become the remote control for\nthe world. Many previously o\ufb04ine devices \u2014 cars, doors, desks, weights, co\ufb00eemakers,\neven toothbrushes \u2014 are coming online. Even pacemakers leave a digital trace.\nThe physical still exists, of course. There are still physical human beings, there are\nstill physical plots of land, there are still physical rivers and mountains. And for some\nlaw enforcement and military functions a network state will need physical robots.\nBut in a network state, everything physical is downstream of lines of code and enforced\nby cryptography, just as in a nation state, everything physical is downstream of pieces\nof paper and enforced by the police and military.\nAssumption: The State Becomes An Admin Dashboard\nA second assumption is that once every interface is digital, it can be put online. And\nonce online, in the absence of private keys, it can be centrally controlled.\nSo, the network state system assumes that states like the USA and PRC will continue\ncentralizing the power of their tech companies into one all-seeing dashboard, capable\nof surveilling, deplatforming, freezing, and sanctioning millions at once, or anyone at\nwill. This digital power is currently exercised transnationally and without the consent\nof the governed. They have no true free choice of administrator.", "num_tokens": 1986}, "156": {"document": "The network state system assumes that we can\u2019t fully put this genie back in the bottle,\nbut we can constrain it. Speci\ufb01cally, we grant that every legitimate state will need\nsuch power to govern its subnetwork, for the same reason any centralized service needs\na system administrator with root access. But we also build decentralized services that5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 235\ndo not have any single system administrator, and tools for the physical and digital exit\nof citizens.\nAssumption: Divide Networks Rather than Land\nJustasinthepre-Westphalianperiod, wheretheCatholicChurchexertedtransnational\ncontrol, the digital power wielded by the American and Chinese empires invalidates\ntraditional notions of sovereignty. The Peace of Westphalia equivalent is a network\nstate system that limits the digital power of states solelyto those who have opted in.\nJust as post-Westphalian nation states were limited in control to people within their\nterritory, post-Satoshian network states will be limited in control to people who\u2019ve\nopted into their network. It is a division of the world by network rather than by land.\nAssumption: Consent and Cryptography Constrain\nSo, inshort, intheworldofthenetworkstate, bothstatesandcitizensalikearepowered\nup. Network states have a root dashboard with full access to every digital aspect of the\nnetwork they govern. They also have security from outside interference because access\nto these dashboards is gated via private keys rather than passwords.\nHowever, this immense digital power is typically deployed nonviolently (unlike with\nexisting states) and constrained by cryptographic and physical exit, rather than by\npaper laws or toothless treaties. This is what powers up citizens, who freely choose\nwhether to enter or exit, either collectively or individually.\nThus, the legitimacy of a network state comes not from top-down declamations, but\nfrom bottom-up consent, as each netizen has opted in. A truly oppressive or incompe-\ntent network state loses them to exit, or doesn\u2019t gain citizens in the \ufb01rst place. And\nno state is strong enough to block the ultimate exit that cryptocurrency represents.", "num_tokens": 476}, "157": {"document": "5.3.3 The Network State as a Term\nWe can unpack the term \u201cnetwork state\u201d in several useful and complementary ways.\n1.The network is the nation. The organic, voluntary, bottom-up nation that un-\nderpins the state is formed online in a network. This could be on the basis of\nlanguage, culture, proposition, or some combination thereof. This represents a\ndigital remedy to the phenomenon Putnam identi\ufb01ed in Bowling Alone . In the\nyear 2000, we were bowling alone but by 2020 we were posting together. COVID-\n19 accelerated this process \u2014 people were spread apart in the physical world but\npacked together online.\n2.The network is the territory. VR isn\u2019t yet fully mature, but when it is, we\u2019ll\nidentify the territory of a network state as a subnetwork of the open metaverse.\nWe can understand this if we think about domain names, social pro\ufb01les, and ENS\nnames \u2014 digital land can be created for free, but access to that land can become\nvery valuable (and, when deplatforming is in the cards, very contentious). The236 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nanalogy to land goes very deep \u2014 to fully understand it, you need to understand\ngraph layouts, but in short you can make maps of networks given any graph\nadjacency matrix. And if you use the distance metric of \u201cnumber of degrees of\nseparation in a social network,\u201d that looks quite di\ufb00erent from the map you get\nfrom a geographical distance matrix.\n3.The network is the state. How does a network state create and enforce laws?\nDigitally. It\u2019sLocke\u2019sjusti\ufb01cationofthestateastheprotectorofprivateproperty,\nin the form of a digital registry. And it\u2019s Lessig\u2019s code-is-law, but on-chain. Our\nentire antiquated process of adversarially writing high-stakes laws on paper at\nthe last minute, deploying them in production to hundreds of millions of people\nwithout any testing, and then getting them interpreted in unpredictable ways by\nregulators and solicitors will be seen as a bizarre relic of an older time. Paper\nlaws will go the way of powdered wigs.\n4.The Network is the Leviathan. Here, we capitalize Network as it\u2019s being used\nin the sense of God, State, Network. The Network here is a candidate for the\nmost powerful force in the world, where the Leviathan in the Hobbesian sense\nis not divinity (God) or military (the State) but community and cryptography\n(Network). From this viewpoint, the Network State can be seen as a fusion of\nLeviathans, like the God/State combination of the mid-century USA, where the\nMarines fought for \u201cGod and Country\u201d and where Americans pledged allegiance\nto the \ufb02ag \u201cunder God.\u201d\nSo: in a network state, the network is the lives (national network), the land (metaverse\nsubnet), the law (governance network), and the Leviathan (Bitcoin network) all packed\ninto one. It\u2019s the people, the digital territory they occupy, the rules that bind them,\nand the power that enforces those laws.", "num_tokens": 724}, "158": {"document": "5.3.4 Micronetworks and Multinetworks\nWe noted earlier that a micronation is really a microstate, and many \u201cnation states\u201d\nare actually multinational empires. These concepts generalize to networks.\nWe can think of a micronetwork as a startup that intends to build a social network,\nbut has zero users. So a micronetwork is like a micronation that plants a \ufb02ag, but\nhas zero citizens. Similarly, a multinetwork like Facebook is a billion-person-scale\nsocialnetworkwithmanysubnetworksunderonecompany...justlikethemultinational\nRoman Empire, where many di\ufb00erent groups were ruled by one state. Perhaps there\u2019s\na reason Zuck admires Augustus.\nBut the analogy breaks down in an important way.\nStartups create Networks, but Nations create States\nIn a \u201cmicronetwork,\u201d aka a startup, the startup createsthe network that it ends up\nmanaging, both in the sense of the people in that network and the digital domain itself.5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 237\nZuck came \ufb01rst, then registered thefacebook.com ; only then came the users. But in a\nreal nation, the people and their physical domain precedethe state. For example, the\nJapanese people and islands predate the current Japanese government.\nThat\u2019s one way people went wrong with micronations. You can\u2019t just treat them like\na normal startup where you start with one person and build an impersonal product!\nThe prospective network state founder needs to think about \u201cnation building\u201d from day\none. That\u2019s not just community building on steroids \u2014 ideally, that nation building\nprocess is really nation discovery . In other words, there\u2019s an existing community out\nthere with an unexpressed national identity at the top of their identity stack, and they\nwant to crowdfund territory and build their decentralized Zion. The network state is\nthen just a catalyst for this.\nStartups create Networks, but Startups aren\u2019t States\nOf course, people have also gone wrong with the startup-to-state analogy in a di\ufb00erent\nway: by thinking startups could act just like states without a legitimating process.\nSuppose we try the analogy that \u201cstate is to a startup as nation is to network.\u201d That\nis, just as a state manages a nation and sets its laws, a startup like early Facebook or\nTwitter manages a social network and sets its policy.\nThis worked, until it didn\u2019t. Facebook and Twitter have succeeded beyond anyone\u2019s\nexpectations, yet they weren\u2019t set up to be governments. People didn\u2019t consciously\nsign a social contract to be governed by them. Facebook and Twitter grew to take over\nmuch of people\u2019s lives, but have no concept of digital property rights. Seizures and\nsilencing weren\u2019t part of the bargain.\nStartupscreateCentralizedNetworks, butChainscreateDecentralizedNet-\nworks\nThere are at least two ways to add genuine choice, and hence legitimacy, to centralized\nnetworks.\n1.Free the backend. On a free spot of land, you can have a nation without a\ngoverning state. Similarly, if we had a free region of the cloud, we could have\na network without a governing startup. That\u2019s what Satoshi did: he reopened\nthe frontier, gave us a cloud without corporations. He showed us how to create\ndigital networks without any single centralized authority. One extension of that\ngives us decentralized social networks, the basis for an open metaverse. So that\u2019s\none way to solve the problem: build digital land that isn\u2019t controlled by any\nsingle startup. Anyone on that land could then freely choose between governance\nnetworks.\n2.Free the login. The other, related way out is to retro\ufb01t an existing centralized\nsocialnetworktoenableweb3login, suchthatuserscancontacteachother outside\nthe service and their usernames are not locked into the system. Note that this238 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nis far more substantive than merely allowing users to \u201cexport their data\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s\nmore like the capability to message your followers without Facebook or Twitter\u2019s\npermission.\nOnly Decentralized Networks can give rise to Network States\nWithout one or ideally both of these features (decentralized backend and decentralized\nlogin), a micronetwork might grow into a multinetwork, just like 0-person Facebook\nbecame 3 billion-person Facebook...but it wouldn\u2019t have the legitimation of exit that\nenables a true network state.

Basedonsomemetric\u2014suchaslinguisticdistance, genomicdistance, ideological\ndistance, or cryptocurrency holdings \u2014 the nodes of a bona \ufb01de nation should group\nmore tightly with each other than they do with other networks.240 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nIn mathematical terms, nations are highly connected subgraphs of a global network\naccording to one or more network distance metrics, like\n\u2022geographic distance : great circle distance on surface of earth\n\u2022network distance : degrees of separation in a social network\n\u2022genetic distance : eg,F(\ufb01xation index) or another measure\n\u2022linguistic distance : eg, lexicostatistical measures\n\u2022economic distance : eg, 1 \u2014 cosine similarity\n\u2022ideological distance : degree of similarity in belief as expressed by spatial theory\nof voting\nThe advantage of this de\ufb01nition is that while it\u2019s still fuzzy (how connected exactly\ndoes the subgraph have to be?), it\u2019s now amenable to quantitative analysis. Given a\nnetwork, a set of distance metrics, and some parameter choices, the subgraphs pop out.\nBy this de\ufb01nition, a real nation would have more ingroup than outgroup connections,\nmore \u201cdomestic\u201d than \u201cinternational\u201d calls.\nA Computational Approach\nHere\u2019s how you\u2019d actually do that computation.\n\u2022Begin with any large N-network like Twitter with K= 300Musers andNpostu-\nlated subnetworks. Calculate any or all of the following distance metrics between\nindividuals, if you have available data, using the de\ufb01nitions from the preceding\nsection.\n\u2013d(geographic distance)\n\u2013d(network distance)\n\u2013d(genetic distance)\n\u2013d(linguistic distance)\n\u2013d(economic distance)\n\u2013d(ideological distance)\n\u2022Suppose we have six such metrics. Calculate them on Kpeople, to form a K\u0002\nK\u00026tensor of distances.\n\u2022Also collect a training set of labeled edges, where two people are marked as being\npart of the same 1-network or not, designated by Y= 1. For example, you might\nput two English-speaking Bitcoin holders who own guns, subscribe to r/keto,\nand follow each other on Twitter in the same 1-network.\n\u2022Now use any machine learning technique to estimate P(Y= 1jd). Something\nlike Naive Bayes can work, or something more sophisticated.5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 241\n\u2022Finally, set a threshold of say P(Y= 1jd)>0:50. All the densely connected\nsubgraphs that pop out of that process are the 1-networks.\nInotherwords, givenasetofpostulatedmeasuresofnationalsimilarity, abitoftraining\ndata, and a parameter choice, we can clustera large network into subgraphs. Applied\nto continental scale social networks like Facebook and Twitter, we\u2019d be able to see\ndi\ufb00erent kinds of clusters pop out for di\ufb00erent parameter choices, much like you do\nwith the lasso.\nAssuming you could get access to a global dataset like Facebook or Twitter\u2019s network\n(or scrape it), you could turn all philosophical disputes about what a nation is into\nsimply a set of parameter choices.

The value of land is based on location, location,\nlocation, but for digital real estate it\u2019s connection, connection, connection.\n\u2022Invisibility . We take for granted that we can see the Franco/German border, that\nwe know who is on either side. But no one can really see the Facebook/Twitter\nborder, the set of users that have accounts on both services but use them both for\nroughly 50% of their time online. Borders between nation states are by default\nhighly visible, borders between networks are by default invisible.\nThis last point is truly deep: we\u2019re going back to terra incognita , toterra nullius , to\nthe time of secret societies, to the time of \u201cHere Be Dragons.\u201d The open web is already\ndark to all but Google, the social web is already dark to all but Facebook and Twitter\net al., and while the third web will have some parts that are globally transparent, much\nof it will be intentionally private and encrypted.\nThis is not a bad thing; in many ways, what we did over the last few decades was\nupload the entire world in unencrypted form online. Never before has it been possible\nfor so many to stalk anyone. The re-encryption of the world has started with a tactical\nretreat from public social networks towards Signal groups, but it will go much further.\nWe may have hit peak map. Cartography becomes harder in a digital space that\u2019s\ndarker and more dynamic than the well-lit physical world. Continents, once discovered,\ndon\u2019t tend to move on you, but the internet brings us back to the time of Pangaea \u2014\nmillions of nodes can disconnect and reconnect elsewhere all at once should they see\n\ufb01t, and new supercontinents of 100M+ connected users like TikTok can just arise out\nof nowhere.\nIn short, our intuitions for digital space are just completely di\ufb00erent from physical\nspace. We\u2019llreturntothistopic, butrecognizethatitreallyisafundamentaldi\ufb00erence:\nwhile the nation state is based on a deterministic physical division of landinto states,\nthe network state is based on probabilistic digital division of peopleinto subnetworks.\nExample: Physically Proximal, Digitally Divergent\nTake a look at this tweet. It shows that in physical space, the red and blue areas of the\nUnited States are cheek-by-jowl, but in digital space they are wholly disjoint. Thus,\nthe US is not really a \u201cnation\u201d state. It\u2019s at least a binational state, what we\u2019d call a5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 243\n2-network, with two strongly connected subgraphs at each other\u2019s throats. These two\nnations are packed into the same physical environment, but are far apart mentally.\nA network state makes the opposite tradeo\ufb00. It\u2019s a group of people spread out in\nphysical space, but highly aligned in digital space. It\u2019s a 1-network, not an N-network.", "num_tokens": 1225}, "162": {"document": "5.3.8 How is a Network State Founded?\nWe just talked about the need for a 1-network to be the basis of a network state,\nunlike an N-network. A 1-network is a focused, moderated community like Ethereum\nResearch, while an N-network is something like Facebook in the early 2020s, with N\ncommunities under its multibillion-person banner (where N is very large).\nBut there\u2019s another constraint for network state creation beside the 1-network, and\nthat\u2019s the constraint of reality. Saying \u201cI\u2019m founding a network state\u201d is a little like\nsaying \u201cI\u2019m founding a billion-dollar public company.\u201d It\u2019s not an impossible goal,\nbut it\u2019s di\ufb03cult, and we want to avoid terminological dilution and encourage realistic\nambition.\nIf we think about the startup community, we have a few de\ufb01nitions that allow us to\ntalk about stages. We have startup companies and tech companies. We have seed, VC,\nand growth investors. We have bootstrapped companies and we have venture-backed\ncompanies. We have early stage vehicles, billion-dollar unicorns, and trillion-dollar tech\ngiants.\nAlong the same lines, let\u2019s introduce a few de\ufb01nitions that help us establish the path\nto the network state.\nAs umbrella terms, we\u2019ll use the concepts of startup societies and parallel societies,\nwhichareroughlyanalogoustostartupsandtechcompaniesrespectively. Likeastartup\n(and unlike a small business), a startup society is a small group with ambitions of doing\nbig things. Like a tech company (and unlike a legacy entity), a parallel society is a\nsmall-to-large group of people with at least one proposed major innovation relative to\nhow things were done before.\nAs sequential terms, we\u2019ll talk about network unions, network archipelagos, and net-\nwork states. These are roughly analogous to seed, Series B, and public companies\nrespectively in terms of how much e\ufb00ort it takes to build them. A network union is\nfully digital but is a real organization with money and a purpose, like a seed startup\nthat no longer merely exists on paper but has daily todos and folks doing things. A\nnetwork archipelago has built up enough money to crowdfund physical territory, like\na Series B company that has earned enough money to be taken more seriously. And a\nnetwork state has achieved diplomatic recognition from at least one legacy state, like a\npublic company that has jumped through all the necessary hoops to be recognized by\nthe NASDAQ.244 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nThose are rough de\ufb01nitions. Let\u2019s get a bit more precise.\nStartup Societies\nYou\u2019re founding a startup society, not a network state.\nA startup society is a new community built internet-\ufb01rst, usually for the purpose of\nsolving a speci\ufb01c social problem in an opt-in way. The implication is that this society\nis still pretty small in population.\nA parallel society is roughly equivalent to a startup society, but can be much larger in\nscale. This is an umbrella term for a network union, network archipelago, or network\nstate.\nAnd now we have a way to talk about origins in a realistic way. You\u2019re founding a\nstartup society. You begin as a network union, maybe crowdfund territory to become\na network archipelago, and could someday grow into a network state. All of these are\ntypes of parallel societies.\nThis communicates the point that there are di\ufb00erent paths to a network state, and\ndi\ufb00erent (and completely valid) intermediate end points \u2014 just like you can run a\nsmall business, a lifestyle business, do a merger/acquisition, or found a \u201cmere\u201d unicorn\nrather than going public and achieving a trillion dollar valuation in the public markets.\nI\u2019d roughly calibrate the di\ufb03culty of founding a 1M person network state that achieves\ndiplomatic recognition from at least one city, state, or country at about the level of\nfounding a 10M person social network or a billion dollar company. Why? Because\nsmall countries like Tuvalu, El Salvador, and the like havealready signed business\ndevelopment deals with startups, so it\u2019s no longer unheard of \u2014 just di\ufb03cult.\nHowever, even if your ultimate goal is a unicorn, you don\u2019t start out by saying \u201cI\u2019m\nfounding a unicorn.\u201d You say you\u2019re founding a startup.\nBy analogy, what do you say, rather than \u201cI\u2019m founding a network state\u201d? The closest\nthing out there was once \u201cI\u2019m starting a decentralized autonomous organization\u201d (a\nDAO). That\u2019s better than \u201cI\u2019m starting a social network,\u201d because a DAO at least\nhas an implicit concept of national identity, in the form of common coin-holding. A\nsocial network does nothave this, because most social networks, by dint of being social\nutilities, \ufb02y past 1-networks and become N-networks if they are successful. However,\nDAOs also are bedeviled by the downsides of markets and politics respectively: \ufb02y-by-\nnight speculators and bureaucratic boondoggles abound.\nSo, if you want to eventually build a network state, you should instead start by saying\n\u201cI\u2019m founding a startup society.\u201d\nParallel Societies\nWe also use the term parallel society . This is roughly equivalent to a startup society,\nbut can be much larger in scale. It\u2019s an umbrella term for a network union, network5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 245\narchipelago, or network state. It emphasizes that you have a possibly huge society\nrunning in parallel to legacy society, with at least one big piece that is wildly di\ufb00erent\nfrom the existing world.\nWe discussed parallel societies in Chapter 2 .\nThe Network Union\nA network union is a social graph organized in a tree-like structure with a leader, a\npurpose, a crypto-based \ufb01nancial and messaging system, and a daily call-to-action. It\u2019s\nthe underpinning of the new nation behind a network state. It forms dense peer-to-peer\nconnections, not simply leader-to-follower. And it acclimatizes its members to working\ntogether as a society towards a common purpose.\nThatpurposemakes it di\ufb00erent from a social network like Twitter, a subreddit, or even\na DAO. The purpose isn\u2019t to waste time, or aimlessly speculate on a token. It\u2019s to\nadvance the collective interests of its members through daily actions, organized by a\nnetwork union leader.\nThat common purpose creates a culture, and gradually turns a group of people into\na 1-network, a network with national consciousness, into the foundation of a network\nstate. Think about it: if people won\u2019t even show up to vote online, they don\u2019t care\nabout the community. Conversely, if they\u2019ve managed to do great things together as\npart of a network union, they\u2019ll be able to do more.\nAnd that is in fact Renan\u2019s de\ufb01nition of a nation:\nTo have done great things together, to want to do more, such are the es-\nsential conditions to form a people...Man is not a slave to his race, or his\ntongue, or his religion.\nSee also this earlier piece on network unions, before we tightened up some of the\nde\ufb01nitions.\nPublic Displays of Alignment\nAnetworkuniondoesn\u2019tjustdoprivateactionsforthecollectivebene\ufb01tofitsmembers.\nIt also does public actions which show the world at large how organized, aligned, self-\nsacri\ufb01cing, and mutually cooperating the members of the network union are. Call these\npublic displays of alignment , a decorous ri\ufb00 on the American concept of PDA.\nAs motivation, think about the many movies that center the tango in a campy-yet-\nserious way. Dramatic music plays as man and woman lock eyes across the room\nbefore beginning a series of complicated pirouettes. The dance \ufb02oor clears a circle as\neveryone pauses to watch. The whole room is now paying rapt attention to this couple,\neven if they didn\u2019t know them before.\nThat\u2019s an example of positive-sum attention: because these two paid attention to each\notherin a public and synchronized way, others paid respectful attention to them. That246 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\ncouple must love each other very much \u2014 or at least must practice very much \u2014 and\ntheir coordination demands admiration. Even the onlooker who doesn\u2019t much care for\ndancing must give a grudging nod.", "num_tokens": 1998}, "163": {"document": "Other examples of positive-sum attention like this include orchestras, parades, the good\nkind of \ufb02ash mobs, basketball games, and the types of gymnastic enterprises common\nto college football halftime shows wherein cheerleaders form tall human pyramids that\nrequire complete trust in the people at the base.\nAll of these are examples of public multi-party coordination where people are creating\nart together in a high-trust society. The coordination is pleasing to the eye. But it also\nindicates to the audience that the people involved have practiced before, that they\u2019re\naligned, that they aren\u2019t all playing whatever notes they want at whatever time, that\nthere is some pre-arranged give and take. Public displays of positive-sum attention\nshow that two or more people can work together as a team.\nThe opposite also exists: negative-sum attention. When two people who are supposed\nto be aligned \ufb01ght in public, when a corporation like the Washington Post melts down\non Twitter, or when a whole country broadcasts its endless internal con\ufb02ict to the globe\neach day, bystanders have a di\ufb00erent reaction. It\u2019s not one of admiration and respect\nfor the tight coordination. It\u2019s the opposite. The con\ufb02ict causes a diminution of status\nfor all parties involved. The phrase \u201cteam of rivals\u201d draws our attention because rivals\ncan\u2019t really make up a team. A organization characterized by public in\ufb01ghting isn\u2019t an\norganization, it\u2019s an occasion for popcorn or pity.\nTwo notes before we move to the main point.\nFirst, the kind of public con\ufb02ict seen in a hard-fought NBA game or an Oxford-style\ndebate is di\ufb00erent, because a viewer could come away with respect for bothwinner and\nloser. Why? That kind of con\ufb02ict is between clearly delineated parties, within certain\nrules that both entertain and constrain. It\u2019s ritualized con\ufb02ict, it\u2019s expected. The loser\noften gets paid for showing up. So it\u2019s not a lose/lose \ufb01ght, not a cartoonish bar brawl.\nSecond, it\u2019s impossible to run any organization of su\ufb03cient scale without somedegree\nof internal misalignment. You don\u2019t get to 500 million friends without making a few\nenemies. There\u2019s always someone with hard feelings \u2014 the envious, the disgruntled,\nthe \ufb01red. They might start a \ufb01ght to gain what they could not by other means. The\nconsequent loss of status that accompanies a public \ufb01ght is like the loss of money that\naccompanies a bad earnings report. It\u2019s not desirable, but it\u2019s absolutely survivable.\nTo make up for the loss of money, you work harder next time. But to make up for\nthe loss of status, you take a beat and \ufb01gure out how to reunify your organization and\nshow a united front to the world. In a phrase, you need some PDA: a public display of\nalignment.\nPoliticians do public displays of alignment all the time. They trash each other during\nthe primaries and then raise each others\u2019 hands in the general election. They\u2019re putting\ntheir di\ufb00erences behind them to build a united front. Countries do this too \u2014 that\u2019s5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 247\nwhat peace treaties, mutual defense pacts, joint military exercises, and international\norganizations are all about. The visual of \ufb02ags \ufb02ying together shows others that they\u2019re\none unit.\nAnd that brings us to the concept of public displays of alignment for a network union.\nIt\u2019s important to startby organizing the network union to do private tasks that the\ngroup as a whole bene\ufb01ts from. But eventually you want to show the external world\nthat your network union can do impressive public things as a group.\nSo, what\u2019s the digital version of a parade, or of a group singing in unison like the\nEstonian Singing Revolution? It might be something like a crypto-Wikipedia, or some\nkind of collectively authored art in virtual reality, perhaps like Minecraft or Reddit\u2019s\nr/place. It may need to involve proof-of-human so onlookers know that this piece of\ndigital art involved real people.\nButwhateveritis, publicdisplaysofalignmentareawayforanetworkuniontonotjust\nquietly deliver value for its members (as it should), but to also publicly demonstrate to\nthe world that it\u2019s a tightly coordinated unit \u2014 and worthy of being treated as such.\nProving to the world that your network union can coordinate like an organic nation is\na \ufb01rst step in the long process towards eventual diplomatic recognition.\nThe New Tokenomics is Nation Formation\nIn the 2000s, most technologists didn\u2019t care that much about how national currencies\nwere run. The parameter choices of a currency were things only central bankers cared\nabout. What\u2019s the interest rate? Is it a de\ufb02ationary, in\ufb02ationary, or even demurrage\ncurrency? Which actors have root access to the system and under what circumstances\ncan they be deplatformed? And so on.\nBut all those details and more became important for people founding new currencies.\nThus, the concept known as \u201ctokenomics\u201d arose: setting up the \ufb01nancial and social\nincentives of a new cryptoeconomic community in a user- and organization-aligned\nway.\nSimilarly, all previously obscure details of how nations and states formed are newly\nrelevant to network union founders. There\u2019s an idea maze for nation formation just as\nthere is for cryptoeconomics. The \ufb01rst question any network union founder needs to\nbe able to answer is: what is your nation formation strategy?\nPath to the Network State\nWe can now de\ufb01ne a path to the network state:\n1.Network union. A wholly digital entity, organized in a social tree structure, that\nengages in collective action on behalf of its members. The collective action is key\nfor building organizational muscle.\n2.Network archipelago. A network union that begins acquiring and networking248 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nproperties in the physical world. The physical interaction is key for building\ntrust.\n3.Network state. A network archipelago that gains diplomatic recognition from at\nleast one legacy state. The diplomatic recognition is key for attaining sovereignty.\nOf course, the delineation between these categories is fuzzy. For example, a network\narchipelagowith100k+people, billionsinannualcollectiveincome, andalargephysical\nfootprint around the world could be deemed a shadow network state. It would have\nmore organization than most stateless nations, as it would actually have a state and\nland, just not all in one place. All it would lack is recognition.\nSlight fuzziness notwithstanding, this is a realistic path from a single network union\nfounder to something big.\nThe Bootstrap Recognizer\nWe call the \ufb01rst government to recognize a network state a bootstrap recognizer , named\nafter the computer science concept of a \u201cbootstrap\u201d system that boots up another.\nThe bootstrap recognizer is to a network state what El Salvador was to Bitcoin: the\nformal acceptance of the new system by the old to form something stronger than either\nof them individually.\nEach network archipelago that wants to become a network state should have a thesis\non who its bootstrap recognizer is. It will likely be an existing state with many \u201cbi-\nnationals\u201d that have formal legal citizenship with their existing nation state but have\nmentally migrated to become dual citizens of their new network state. The historical\nanalog is those who identi\ufb01ed as Israelis or Indians even before their states became\nformally independent.\nNote that while a bootstrap recognizer will initially have to be a nation state, once\nthere are many network states of signi\ufb01cant scale, network states could bootstrap the\nrecognition of other network states.\nDigital Civil Society\nNetwork unions, network societies, and other forms of digital civil society are valuable\nendpoints in themselves.\nFor example, a serious open source project could have an associated network union\nthat advances the collective interest of (say) a guild of ReactJS programmers, without\nany need to buy land.\nOr a \ufb01tness in\ufb02uencer could turn their online community into a network archipelago,\nreplete with gyms around the world, organizing people to get discounted keto-friendly\nfood.5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 249\nYou can probably come up with other kinds of structures. The overall idea is to build\ndigital civil society , allthosecommunityorganizationsthataren\u2019teitherthestateabove\nor the isolated individual below, the kind of non-political voluntary associations that\nonce built America, according to Tocqueville:", "num_tokens": 1987}, "164": {"document": "I do not wish to speak of those political associations...Here it is a question\nonly of the associations that are formed in civil life and which have an ob-\nject that is in no way political... Americans of all ages, all conditions, all\nminds constantly unite. Not only do they have commercial and industrial\nassociations in which all take part, but they also have a thousand other\nkinds: religious, moral, grave, futile, very general and very particular, im-\nmense and very small; Americans use associations to give f\u00eates, to found\nseminaries, to build inns, to raise churches, to distribute books, to send\nmissionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they create hospitals, prisons,\nschools. Finally, if it is a question of bringing to light a truth or developing\na sentiment with the support of a great example, they associate. Every-\nwhere that, at the head of a new undertaking, you see the government in\nFrance and a great lord in England, count on it that you will perceive an\nassociation in the United States.\nThese had vanished by the year 2000, according to Putnam:\nPutnam draws on evidence including nearly 500,000 interviews over the\nlast quarter century to show that we sign fewer petitions, belong to fewer\norganizations that meet, know our neighbors less, meet with friends less fre-\nquently, and even socialize with our families less often. We\u2019re even bowling\nalone.\nThe network union and network archipelago are ends in themselves. They give us a\nroadmap for rebuilding digital civil society, to start doing things together with purpose\nand substance online, to move away from the distracting entropy of social media and\nthe news towards communities of conscious intent. And from these network unions and\nnetwork societies, we will form network states.\nRecognize Why We Need Recognition\nWe just described why network states need more than community, and even more\nthan economic alignment \u2014 they need a sense of national consciousness, of collective\npurpose, as provided by a network union. Now let\u2019s discuss why we need recognition.\nA fun one liner is that crypto made progressives more libertarian and libertarians more\nprogressive. Progressives discovered that you can build stateless money. Libertari-\nans discovered that you then need to rebuild something much like a state: identity,\nreputation, anti-fraud, custody, trust, community, and the like.\nWe think network states will have a similar dynamic. If they work, they\u2019ll show pro-\ngressives a di\ufb00erent path to political innovation \u2014 rather than grinding through a250 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nthankless legacy system, they can use their organizing skills to help start a new one.\nBut libertarian founders of network unions will similarly need to take a page from the\nprogressive playbook. While libertarians are drawn to network states for the same\nreason they\u2019re interested in competitive government, seasteading, and micronations,\nlibertarian literature underemphasizes the necessity of diplomatic recognition.\nDiplomatic recognition is as essential to a network state as exchange listing and wallet\nsupport is to a cryptocurrency. There are technical aspects to money, but it is also an\ninherently social phenomenon. Contrast this to an airplane, which will \ufb02y regardless\nof what anyone thinks.\nSimilarly, whileanetworkunioncanget startedwithoneperson, andevenbuylandand\nbecome a network archipelago, to cross the chasm it needs a plan for gaining diplomatic\nrecognition \u2014 to go from \u201cunpopular but feasible\u201d to \u201cpopular and important.\u201d\nLack of recognition limits sovereignty. In a sense, diplomatic recognition is a partial,\nnon-binding, but still meaningful commitment from a legacy state to respect the inter-\nnal sovereignty of the new network state, to admit it to the family of nations, to open\nup a number of di\ufb00erent avenues for trade and institutional innovation.\nGetting there means the founders of a network union that wants to become a network\nstate can\u2019t be misanthropic, or even isolationist in mentality. A live and let live men-\ntality won\u2019t be enough; you\u2019ll need to recruit people who win and help win. Because\nunlike an empire, the end goal of a network state is not world domination; it\u2019s world\nrecognition.", "num_tokens": 957}, "165": {"document": "5.3.9 Why Would we Found a Network State?\nBut why? Why do we need the ability to found a network state? Why can\u2019t we reform\none of the perfectly good countries on the planet?\nFirst, these countries are notperfectly good. Just as it was easier to start a new digital\ncurrency than to reform the Fed, it may be easier to start a new country than to reform\nyours.\nSecond, we want new countries for the same reason we want blank sheets of paper,\nfresh plots of land, or new startups: to begin anew without baggage from the old.\nAnd third, for certain kinds of technologies \u2013 particularly transformative biotech like\nlife extension \u2013 we need new jurisdictions with fundamentally di\ufb00erent levels of risk-\ntolerance, and clear-eyed consent by all who opt in.\nThere\u2019s something in it for both engineers and activists, for both the technological\ninnovator and the political progressive.\nNetwork States for the Technological Innovator\nWhy should technologists care about politics?5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 251\n\u2022The scienti\ufb01c innovation . Fred Ehrsam wrote that peaceful innovation in gover-\nnance is more important for innovation than we realize. After all, the Catholic\nChurch burned proponents of heliocentrism at the stake; it wouldn\u2019t have in-\nvented space shuttles. And the Soviet Union banned photocopiers; it wouldn\u2019t\nhave allowed the internet. Today, we see that San Francisco is banning everything\nfrom scooters to straws, but what we don\u2019t see is what didn\u2019t even make it out\nof the garage.\n\u2022The physical world . The state controls the physical world. With su\ufb03cient con-\nsent, any law can be changed, and any regulation can be sunset, or reinvented.\nThis is how \u201cbits\u201d unlock innovation in \u201catoms\u201d: we form opt-in communities\nonline to unlock innovation o\ufb04ine.\n\u2022The economics . Money isn\u2019t everything, but it\u2019s crucial to making something\nsustainable. we know that antiquated taxi regulations held back one hundred\nbillion dollars in the form of Uber/Lyft/Grab/Didi, that \ufb01nancial regulations\nheld back one trillion dollars in the form of Bitcoin/Ethereum, and communism\nheld back the Chinese people to the tune of ten trillion dollars (namely the entire\nChinese economy).\n\u2022The data . Technologists can think of new opt-in states as experiments. Just\nas the ability to start new currencies moved us from observational to empirical\nmacroeconomics, the ability to start new countries takes us from the realm of\npolitical science \u2014 the study of what is \u2014 to political technology, the engineering\nof what can be.\n\u2022The platform . We can think of the state as our most important platform, more\nimportant even than Apple or Amazon, the place where much of our data and\nlives are hosted. Right now, we can\u2019t upgrade the state. What if we could?\n\u2022The ethics . Just as many kinds of things become easier to build in the presence of\na cooperative centralized server, many more things become easier in the presence\nofacooperativecentralizedstate. Anetworkstatebuildsasocietywhereeveryone\nhas broad support for technological innovation. You want a country where people\ncheer Mission Control, not boo Musk and Bezos, and now we can build one.\nOf course, network states aren\u2019t for every technologist. If you care mainly about\ncompilers or programming languages, you can get by under the current dispensation.\nAnd if all you want is a steady paycheck at Big Tech, a network state is not for you.\nBut if you care about accelerating innovation in the physical world, we \ufb01nally have an\nanswer.\nNetwork States for the Political Progressive\nWhy should political progressives want to start new cities and countries?\n\u2022If you\u2019re a young politician, perhaps you don\u2019t want to wait till you\u2019re 70 years\nold to pay your dues and make your mark.252 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\n\u2022If you\u2019re a community organizer, network unions give you a digital community to\norganize, sometimes against states and corporations, but also for the bene\ufb01t of\nindividual members\u2019 open source projects, businesses, and consulting gigs.\n\u2022If you\u2019re an advocate for a stateless nation like the Catalonians or the Kurds,\nnetwork unions and eventually network states give a new path to recognition.\n\u2022If you\u2019re a policy wonk, network states allow you to run ethical experiments on\npolicy, with opt-in participants that are as interested in governance innovation as\nyou are. You can experiment with digital democracy, new forms of government,\nor anything you think interesting.\n\u2022If you\u2019re an idealist, network states bring back the voluntary communes of the\nmid-1800s America, where people could opt-in to build their own vision of utopia.\n\u2022If you\u2019re an anarchist, network unions o\ufb00er a vision of horizontal collaboration\nin the absence of traditional governance and without coercion.\n\u2022If you\u2019re an urban planner, network societies allow you to build support and\namass funding to crowdfund your vision of the good.\nIn short, whether you want to experiment with reforms or entirely new forms of gov-\nernment, there\u2019s likely something in the concept of network unions, network societies,\nand network states that will suit you.\nMoreover, these structures are far more democratic than the coercive governance struc-\ntures of the legacy system, because they\u2019re all opt-in. 100% of members of a network\nunion or network state have chosen to be there, rather than 51% imposing their will\non a reluctant 49%. Network states are models for 100% democracy, not merely 51%\ndemocracy.\nWith that said, the concept of a network state isn\u2019t a panacea. Many political progres-\nsives will be attracted to existing governments for one very simple reason: they already\nexist, and already have socioeconomic power. You don\u2019t need to build everything from\nscratch.\nBut for the idealists and the ambitious who are excited about the possibility of doing\nexactly that, there\u2019s nothing more politically interesting than a new state.", "num_tokens": 1393}, "166": {"document": "5.3.10 How does a Network State Expand and Contract?\nNetwork states give a wholly new way for states to expand. They can grow peacefully\nin the digital world rather than violently in the physical world. The network state\nformation process can begin with a single founding in\ufb02uencer and scale to a million\nperson physical community.\nWe can break out the underlying vectors of growth as follows:\n1.Demographically. Most obviously, a network state (or a predecessor entity like a\nnetwork union or network archipelago) can grow its userbase through recruitment5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 253\nand reproduction. For the latter, the growing state will need some policy to\nrecognize the new family members as netizens, such as jus sanguinis .\n2.Geographically. As the citizenry of a network state grows, it can start crowd-\nfunding more territory in the physical world. This is a peaceful mechanism for\nterritorialexpansion. Notethatthesepurchasesneednotbefromsovereignstates,\nthough they may ultimately be.\n3.Digitally. A complement to geographical growth is digital growth: more domain\nnames, crypto usernames, and social media handles under ownership of netizens\nand the network state.\n4.Economically. The people of a network state will earn income and invest on\nchain. Those numbers, or an aggregate thereof, can be made public to the world\nvia crypto oracles, thereby showing cryptographically provable growth in GDP\nand net worth.\n5.Ideologically. Because a network state is fundamentally a proposition nation, it\u2019s\nconstantly evangelizing its beliefs. But unlike a traditional nation state\u2019s soft\npower, which is not directly tied to immigration policy, here the evangelism is\nexplicitly connected to recruiting.\n6.Technologically . Why call this point out separately? Technological progress is a\nde\ufb01ning feature of a network state to an even greater degree than its nation state\npredecessor. A network state understands that in the absence of innovation, its\nat-will citizens will leave for more advanced jurisdictions in the same way people\nleft Blockbuster for Net\ufb02ix. But because technological innovation is non-zero\nsum, the relentless competitive pressure for mobile citizens means the network\nstate system is positive-sum , which is very unlike the nation state system\u2019s zero-\nsumstruggle for territory.\nThe network state system is not about the battle for borders, but for backlinks (in a\ngeneralized sense). Many of the things that states traditionally fought over can now\nbe abstracted and turned into an economic game. This is a step forward, for the same\nreason that it was a huge advance whenever nations resorted to trade rather than\nconquest to gain access to each others\u2019 natural resources.\nWhat underpins the new dynamic of network states is the intrinsic lack of scarcity of\ndigital territory, the return of unclaimed land and terra nullius , the reopened frontier.\nAs we discuss later on, it was this frontier, this room for experimentation, that built\nAmerica in the \ufb01rst place. Voice was important, but so was choice.\nThus, just like a tech company or a social network, a network state provides a smooth\npath from a single person with a computer and no other resources to a million person\nglobal network. Constant, nonviolent growth is now possible \u2014 not by conquest or\ncoercion, but through volition and innovation.254 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES", "num_tokens": 759}, "167": {"document": "5.3.11 What is not a Network State?\nAs with nation states, it\u2019s useful to give examples that are adjacent to network states,\nbut don\u2019t quite \ufb01t. First, we\u2019ll go over conceptually far away examples; then, a number\nofstructuresthataremuchcloser, whichcanbecomenetworkunions, networksocieties,\nand network states.\nFirst, let\u2019s discuss some things that are actually quite far away from network states,\nbut that are often discussed in the same breath. Each has some important similarities\n(a social network, a global physical footprint) but lacks a key dimension.\n1.Your startup. As discussed earlier, don\u2019t go around saying that you\u2019re starting a\nnetwork state. Say that you\u2019re starting a network union, and build up a commu-\nnity that\u2019s capable of doing collective actions online. Then crowdfund territory\nand turn your online community into a network archipelago with physical pres-\nence. Finally, if all the stars align, gain diplomatic recognition and thendeclare\nyour society a network state. I know this might seem a bit like the Marxist insis-\ntence on the di\ufb00erence between socialism and communism, but the counterpoint\nis that nations haveacquired land and gained diplomatic recognition before \u2014\nand we note that it\u2019s important when they do. They just haven\u2019t done it in quite\nthis way, with this progression. That\u2019s why we want separate terms for network\nunion, network archipelago, and network state.\n2.Twitter, the social network. Twitter is a babble of competing and hostile clans,\nmany of whom don\u2019t speak the same language or (even more importantly) share\nthe same values. In our terminology, it is very much an N-network, not a 1-\nnetwork. I\u2019m not sure how many true national networks there are within Twitter\n(it\u2019d depend on the parameters of our computational algorithm for national dis-\ntillation), but for the US alone it\u2019s at least two \u2014 arguably much more.\n3.WeWork, the coworking space. WeWork\u2019s woes notwithstanding, they built a\nuseful product. But it was more like a utility than a true community, more like\na Starbucks than a small town. Think about it: in a coworking space, the couch\nmight be leather and the co\ufb00ee might be decent, but you don\u2019t leave your laptop\nout of sight because you don\u2019t know anyone there. You need to get a conference\nroom to speak freely, you need to use a privacy screen; in general, it\u2019s not a\nhigh-trust zone. That\u2019s not a true community.\n4.Google, the company. Google the company has a large global physical footprint\nand an even larger digital footprint, with millions of square meters and billions\nof users around the world. It also makes many digital governance decisions per\nday. But its usersaren\u2019t a community, and they don\u2019t really think of Google\nas a legitimate government. Conversely, while its employees do call themselves\nGooglers, they think of their employer as a company rather than a country in\nembryo. And they aren\u2019t really at the stage where they want to work hard on\nbuilding a new nation.5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 255\n5.Bitcoin, the crypto protocol. There are hundreds of millions of holders of Bit-\ncoin worldwide, and the ideas of Satoshi are core to modern thinking on digital\ngovernance. Nevertheless, Bitcoin does only one thing: facilitate uncensorable\ntransactions in Bitcoin. It can be thought of as a meta-government, because it\nconstrainsnetworkandnationstatesalike, butitissilentonthe1000otherthings\nthat even a minarchist agrees a government should do. Moreover, while there is\nsomecommonalityoffeelingbetweenBitcoinholders, therealsostrongdi\ufb00erences\n\u2014 Maximalists are only a subset of the community. Overall, the similarity be-\ntween Bitcoin holders is probably more at the level of English-language speakers\nthan, say, Japanese-language speakers. They can understand each other, or at\nleast understand each others\u2019 premises, but they don\u2019t all have the same vision\nof the good. In short, a digital currency is a prerequisite for a digital country,\nbut they are not equivalent.\nNext, let\u2019s go through some things which are close to a network state, in the sense\nthat they can be converted to an (all-digital) network union or a (digital + physical)\nnetwork archipelago, but are not quite there.\n1.A political party. A political party is close. It has a shared community, it has a\nsense of self and non-self, it has a vision for governance should it gain power, and\nso on. What it doesn\u2019t have is a \u201cshadow\u201d structure where it can administrate\nthe lives of its members even when it is outside of the formal government. It also\ntypically doesn\u2019t own property, or formally facilitate the mingling and migration\nof party members. But all that can be done 24/7 withoutneeding to win the vote\nin a general election, and network unionization may become an interesting route\nfor any minority party.\n2.A network of hacker houses. If all the people in this network know each other well\nenough to leave their laptop on a couch with the con\ufb01dence that no one will steal\nit, then it\u2019s a high-enough trust community to be a proto network archipelago.\nIt may need to layer on governance.\n3.r/keto.A subreddit for diet, like r/keto, has a community, a governance struc-\nture via moderators, and a shared purpose. Don\u2019t laugh \u2014 strict dietary rules\nhave been important for religious practice for centuries, and they are an excellent\nshibboleth for group membership. To build a network union, the members of\nr/ketowould need some kind of collective action that members do together (like\nbulk purchases of keto food or reviews of keto books). To turn it into a network\narchipelago, they might need to start keto clubs and restaurants and link them\ntogether (networked physical territory). Their vision might stop at a cohesive\nsociety, instead of an all-encompassing state; their network archipelago might be\npartof a network state that rejected not just the USDA Food Pyramid, but also\nthe US Fed pyramid schemes.\n4.An in\ufb02uencer or CEO\u2019s following. A popular content creator or CEO is a good\ncandidate for pulling together a network union. There\u2019s alignment, there\u2019s an\nexisting group, and there\u2019s leadership. But they\u2019d need to \ufb01gure out a purpose256 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nfor their community (if an in\ufb02uencer) or a purpose beyond the merely commer-\ncial (if a CEO). That\u2019ll be easier for activists and technologists, and harder for\nentertainers and pure salesmen.\n5.DAOs and NFT communities. As noted earlier, these are also quite close to being\nnetwork unions, but they need to ensure they have members who are there for\nthe long-term cause rather than for the short-term pump. If so, they can start\npulling together communities of purpose towards collective action.\n6.A city state. This bears mentioning too: a city state is nota network state.\nWhy? Because a city state is concentrated in one location, and can be invaded\nby a stronger power, while a network state is geographically decentralized and\nencrypted. It can\u2019t easily be physically invaded without going after all of its\nterritories (many of which may be unlisted, or literal single person apartments),\nwhich would be a politically fraught multi-jurisdiction campaign. And it can\u2019t be\ndigitally invaded without breaking the encryption that protects its constituent\nblockchain. So a network state can be thought of as a v3 of the state, that\ncombines aspects of the scaled nation states of the 20th century with the nimble\ncitystatesthatprecededthem. Ithasthepotentialmassivescaleanddefensibility\nof a billion person nation state, while preserving the innovation and consent of\na small opt-in community. It\u2019s similar to how Bitcoin combines aspects of gold\n(v1) with Fedwire (v2) to produce a v3 system.\nIn short, you need a strong community to even have a chance of building a network\nstate. Twitter at large is not it, Google Inc is not it, Bitcoin is not it \u2014 these lack\neither a single self-conscious nation, a functional state, or both.\nA political party is closer. A very tight-knit NFT community or in\ufb02uencer/CEO fol-", "num_tokens": 1983}, "168": {"document": "lowing is even closer. To get on the path to network states, they would \ufb01rst build\ndigital strength via the network union, then add physical territory via the network\narchipelago, and then gain diplomatic recognition in a true network state.", "num_tokens": 54}, "169": {"document": "5.3.12 WhatTechnologicalDevelopmentsenableNetworkStates?\nVenture capitalists are fond of asking the \u201cwhy now\u201d question to entrepreneurs. Why\nnow? Why can we contemplate founding network states today, and not 5 or 10 or 20\nyears ago? What\u2019s changed in the world?\nWell, a lot has changed. Here are some of the key enablers of the network state:\n1.The Internet is to the USA as the Americas were to the UK. Of course, the\ninternet enables the whole thing. But the manner in which it enables the network\nstate is worth discussing. Think of the internet as a cloud continent, a sort of\ndigital Atlantis that came down from the heavens sometime around 1991 and\nhas parked itself over the middle of the Paci\ufb01c Ocean. Every day, everyone who\nspends (say) 8 hours online is doing the equivalent of \ufb02ying up to this cloud from\nMenlo Park or Tokyo for business or pleasure, and then \ufb02ying back down. While5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 257\nthere, they see new things, meet new people, and sometimes \ufb01ght them. So far,\nwhat we\u2019ve described is much like the settling of the Americas from 1492-1890,\nbut there are at least two key di\ufb00erences. First, of course, the cloud had no\npre-existing people. Second, unlike the vast-but-\ufb01nite soil of America, you can\ncreate new digital land ad in\ufb01nitum in the cloud. As we discuss later on, that\nreopening of the frontier changes everything. It means that the Internet is to the\nUSA as the Americas were to the UK: a wide open territory that ultimately gave\nbirth to new states and ways of thinking.\n2.Bitcoin constrains legacy states. Bitcoin is the next most important prerequi-\nsite for the network state. As a government of governments, it guarantees the\nsovereignty of both the individual citizen andthe network state itself. Neither\ncan have their funds stolen by each other, or by a hostile third party. Bitcoin has\nalso created new fortunes outside the \ufb01at system, demonstrated that institutions\nas powerful as the Fed canbe replaced in a few decades, and pioneered an entirely\nnew way of designing web services in a decentralized manner.\n3.Web3 enables new chains, decentralized identities, and censorship-resistant com-\nmunities. With web3, we can set up a blockchain as the backbone of each network\nstate. This is the community chain that the state-appointed leadership has root\nover, as a complement to a public chain like Bitcoin or Ethereum that serves as\nan external check and balance. We can create decentralized identities similar to\nENS and SNS to serve as digital passports for the network state, de\ufb01ning citizen-\nship on the basis of single sign-on access to network state services. And we can\nallow not just censorship-resistant communication, but censorship-resistant com-\nmunities, voluntary gatherings of people that can exist outside the interference\nor surveillance of legacy states.\n4.Remote and Starlink open up the map. The moment something is put on the\ninternet, it becomes remote friendly. And everything is going on the internet.\nMoreover, remote doesn\u2019t just mean around the corner, it means around the\nworld. Starlink, and satellite broadband more generally, powers up remote fur-\nther, by making huge swaths of the map newly economically feasible. Nothing\nnow prevents a su\ufb03ciently motivated digital community from setting up their\nown Burning Man equivalent in the middle of nowhere, except this time for per-\nmanent habitation, and with an eye towards incorporating formal towns and and\ncities. This complements our earlier point: through the internet, we\u2019re reopening\nthe frontier, and making previously godforsaken areas of the map much more\nattractive. Unlike past eras, you don\u2019t no longer need to be near a port or mine\nto build a city; you just need to be near an internet connection.\n5.Mobile makes us more mobile. Law is a function of latitude and longitude,\nso if you can easily change your latitude and longitude, you can change the\nlaw under which you live. That\u2019s why the most important long-term conse-\nquence of the smartphone is Tiebout sorting. That is, all of the assumptions in\nCharles Tiebout\u2019s famous paper from the 50s become feasible with su\ufb03ciently258 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES\nadvanced phones. With digital nomad search engines like \u2018teleport.org\u2018 and \u2018no-\nmadlist.com\u2018, some people can choose who they want, while others move where\nthey like.\n6.VR builds a capital in the cloud, AR mirrors it on the land. Virtual reality (and\nmore generally the open metaverse) are yet another way in which the obligate\nties to the land are being cut. We can now build full castles in the sky, and then\nwith augmented reality project them onto the earth. For a network archipelago\nor network state, that\u2019s a powerful way to link distributed physical territories\ntogether into a coherent whole.\n7.Social disintermediated the media. Again, this one is almost too obvious, but so-\ncial media allowed anyone to build a massive following online, it disintermediated\nthe legacy media, and (in combination with messaging apps and related tools) it\nmade one\u2019s contacts in\ufb01nitely pportable.\n8.GAFAM showed us what\u2019s possible, startup/VC showed us how. None of the web3\nworld would be possible without the web2 and web1 worlds. Google showed us\nwhatcouldbedonefromagarage. Facebookshoweduswhatcouldbebuiltfroma\ndorm room. The entire startup industry has shown us that big things can be done\non a shoestring. Without the trillion dollar companies and billion user networks,\nwe wouldn\u2019t feel like we could build million person network states. In particular,\nas Gilles Babinet observed, once you see partial transfers of sovereignty in the\ndigital world, you know more may come. From the postal service to Gmail, from\ntaxi medallions to Uber and Lyft, from the banks to Bitcoin, from the maps to\nGoogle Maps, from the FCC to WhatsApp, from the courts to moderators, legacy\nstates control less and digital networks control more. Of course, the former lack\ntechnical competence and the latter lack democratic legitimacy, which is exactly\nthe problem the network state solves.\nNext, here are a few things that will be helpful to network states, but are not essential\nfor their construction:\n1.Land becomes elastic. As Will Rogers once said, \u201cbuy land, they ain\u2019t making\nany more of it.\u201d Or are they? Seasteaders and the arti\ufb01cial islands built in\nDubai show that land supply is perhaps more elastic than we think. We also\nknow you can build cruise ships. So it\u2019s possible that we could start reopening\nthe frontier physically as well, not just digitally. This isn\u2019t incompatible with\nGeorgism, which argues that the inelastic supply of land means there should be\nonly one tax, a land tax; it just means the supply is not perfectly inelastic. If\nyou combine the two concepts, if more value creation goes online and away from\nthe physical world, you get the idea of being able to (a) print more land, and\n(b) partially commoditize existing nation states as providers of land and natural\nresources.\n2.Telepresence changes the nature of immigration . The next step after simply\nprojecting in an AR avatar is to dial up a robot on the other side of the world and5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 259\nstart walking around. This should in theory be feasible by combining (a) Boston\nDynamics\u2019 legged robots, (b) DoubleRobotics\u2019 telepresent iPads on wheels, (c) an\nOculus Quest headset, and (d) an omnidirectional treadmill. That combination\nof devices could furnish immersive control of a humanoid robot anywhere on the\nglobe.\n3.Bits reopen innovation in atoms. Innovation in areas like biomedicine, robotics,\nand energy is not upstream of the network state, it\u2019s downstream of it. The\nnetwork state solves the problem posed by Thiel, Cowen, and J Storrs Hall.\nWe\u2019re using bits to reopen innovation in atoms, because innovation in atoms has\nbeen blocked by regulations, which are in turn created by the US establishment\nand exported all over the world through harmonization. The network state uses\ndigital technology to gain su\ufb03cient consent in the cloud to build a community,\ncrowdfund territory, and eventually gain recognition as a sovereign polity. Once\nwe do so, we can return innovation to the physical world.\nThe nation state was enabled by maps of the world, tools to communicate laws, and\nthe guns to enforce them.
