The only requirement is `PyPDF2` so make sure you install the dependency. Then run the `run.py` using something like `python run.py`. You should get an `output.csv` file in your folder. Note that because of some excel parsing issues, I've been uploading to google sheets. Google sheets seems to understand the `output.csv` file but excel seems to have issues. This has apparently has to do with encoding but haven't fixed it yet.
