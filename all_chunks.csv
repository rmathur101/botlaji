0,"1.1 Preamble
Are you the kind of person who skims the beginning just to see whether to read the
entire thing? You’re in luck.
We’ve prepared one sentence, one image, one thousand word, and one essay summaries
of the concepts behind startup societies and network states. Just click those links if
you’re impatient. And of course, for the full experience, you can read it one page at a
time.
Speaking of pages, every section of this book is online and shareable as an individual
web page. For example, the URL to this section is thenetworkstate.com/preamble.
This allows you to link directlyto any bit of the book for discussion. Moreover, unlike
the typical book that’s frozen in time, think of this as a dynamic bookapp that gets
continuously updated. You can see the latest version online, or you can follow the
instructions at thenetworkstate.com/kindle.gif to get the latest version on your Kindle.
When reading it, think of this work as a toolbox, not a manifesto. You don’t need to
agree with all of it to get something out of it. We’ve structured it in modular form
for that reason. Chapter 1 is an overview of the ideas. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 present
an analysis that leads to a concerning forecast for the near future, the problem of
AmericanAnarchyandChineseControl. AndChapter5presentsourproposedsolution
for maintaining liberal values in an illiberal world: startup societies and network states.
If you’re a partisan of the US establishment or the CCP, you may not agree with our
problem statement at all. If you’re an orthodox Bitcoin maximalist, you likely won’t
agree with every aspect of our proposed solution. And if you’re coming in from another
school of thought, you may only agree with parts of the problem or solution as we’ve
framed them. Nevertheless, we believe there’s enough ﬂexibility in the idea of the
network state that you can customize it and make it your own.
81.2. THE NETWORK STATE IN ONE SENTENCE 9
But what exactly isa network state?",495
1,"1.2 The Network State in One Sentence
In one informal sentence:
A network state is a highly aligned online community with a capacity for
collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually
gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states.
When we think of a nation state, we immediately think of the lands, but when we think
of a network state, we should instantly think of the minds. That is, if the nation state
system starts with the map of the globe and assigns each patch of land to a single state,
the network state system starts with the 7+ billion humans of the world and attracts
each mind to one or more networks.
Here’s a more complex deﬁnition that extends that concept and pre-emptively covers
many edge cases:
A network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of na-
tional consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action,
anin-personlevelofcivility, anintegratedcryptocurrency, aconsensualgov-
ernment limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded
physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves
a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a
measure of diplomatic recognition.
OK, that’s a mouthful! It’s lengthy because there are many internet phenomena that
sharesomebutnotallofthepropertiesofanetworkstate. Forexample, neitherBitcoin
nor Facebook nor a DAO is a network state, because each lacks certain qualities – like
diplomatic recognition – which are core to anything we’d think of as the next version
of the nation state.
(If you want to skip ahead, we expand on each part of the deﬁnition in Chapter 5. But
it’ll make more sense if you read the text all the way through. For what it’s worth,
the technical deﬁnition of a nation state is similarly multi-clausal, because it needs to
exclude things we don’t typically think about, like stateless nations.)10 CHAPTER 1. QUICKSTART",479
2,"1.3 The Network State in One ImageA picture helps. The dashboard above shows what a million-person network state looks
like on the map. Speciﬁcally, it depicts a network state with 1.7 million people, more
than 157 billion dollars in annual income, and a 136 million square meter footprint.
The ﬁrst thing we notice is that a network state isn’t physically centralized like a
nation state, nor limited in scale like a city state. It’s geographically decentralized and
connected by the internet.
The second thing we see is that you could feasibly start this kind of country from your
computer. That is, just as Facebook grew from one person’s laptop, a million-person
network state that owns a global archipelago of physical territory could start as a
one-person startup society, as shown in this gif: thenetworkstate.com/networkstate.gif.
The third thing we see is how central the real-time census is to the network state. The
dashboard shown combines concepts from coins, companies, and countries to focus a
society on growthin people, annual income, and real estate footprint.
Continued growth is a continuous plebiscite, a vote of conﬁdence by the people inside
who remain and those outside who apply. Roughly speaking, a successful network state
is one that attracts aligned immigrants, and an unsuccessful network state is one that
loses them.
That doesn’t mean each network state must grow to inﬁnity, or that all states need
accept the same kind of person, but that the community of network states as a whole is
focused on building admirable societies that people want to join. Diﬀerent states will
focus on diﬀerent metrics; imagine a network state premised on improving its citizens’
overall life expectancy, or one aimed at provably right-shifting the income distribution
for all. You get what you measure.1.4. THE NETWORK STATE IN ONE THOUSAND WORDS 11",446
3,"1.4 The Network State in One Thousand WordsTechnology has allowed us to start new companies, new communities, and new curren-
cies. But can we use it to create new cities, or even new countries? A key concept is to
go cloud ﬁrst, land last — but not land never — by starting with an online community
and then materializing it into the physical world. We get there in seven steps:
1.Found a startup society. This is simply an online community with aspirations of
something greater. Anyone can found one, just like anyone can found a company
or cryptocurrency.And the founder’s legitimacy comes from whether people opt
to follow them.
2.Organize it into a group capable of collective action. Givenasuﬃcientlydedicated
online community, the next step is to organize it into a network union . Unlike
a social network, a network union has a purpose: it coordinates its members for
their mutual beneﬁt. And unlike a traditional union, a network union is not
set up solely in opposition to a particular corporation, so it can take a variety
of diﬀerent collective actions.Unionization is a key step because it turns an
otherwise ineﬀective online community into a group of people working together
for a common cause.
3.Build trust oﬄine and a cryptoeconomy online. Begin holding in-person mee-
tups in the physical world, of increasing scale and duration, while simultaneously
building an internal economy using cryptocurrency.12 CHAPTER 1. QUICKSTART
4.Crowdfund physical nodes. Once suﬃcient trust has been built and funds have
been accumulated, start crowdfunding apartments, houses, and even towns to
bring digital citizens into the physical world within real co-living communities.
5.Digitally connect physical communities. Link these physical nodes together into
anetwork archipelago , a set of digitally connected physical territories distributed
aroundtheworld. Nodesofthenetworkarchipelagorangefromone-personapart-
ments to in-person communities of arbitrary size. Physical access is granted by
holding a web3 cryptopassport, and mixed reality is used to seamlessly link the
online and oﬄine worlds.
6.Conduct an on-chain census. As the society scales, run a cryptographically au-
ditable census to demonstrate the growing size of your population, income, and
real-estate footprint. This is how a startup society proves traction in the face of
skepticism.
7.Gain diplomatic recognition. Astartupsocietywithsuﬃcientscaleshouldeventu-
ally be able to negotiate for diplomatic recognition from at least one pre-existing
government, and from there gradually increased sovereignty, slowly becoming a
truenetwork state .
The key idea is to populate the land from the cloud, and do so all over the earth.
Unlike an ideologically disaligned and geographically centralized legacy state, which
packs millions of disputants in one place, a network state is ideologically aligned but
geographically decentralized. The people are spread around the world in clusters of
varying size, but their hearts are in one place.

state, with millions of citizens and billions in income, it should eventuallybe able to
attain recognition from existing sovereigns — and ultimately the United Nations —
just as Bitcoin has now become a bona ﬁde national currency.",768
4,"1.5 The Network State in One Essay
A proposition is not a nation, though it can become one. Here we describe a peaceful,
reproducible process for turning an online community premised on a proposition into
a physical state with a virtual capital: a network state , the sequel to the nation state.
We want to be able to peacefully start a new state for the same reason we want a bare
plot of earth, a blank sheet of paper, an empty text buﬀer, a fresh startup, or a clean
slate. Because we want to build something new without historical constraint.
The ﬁnancial demand for a clean slate is clear. People buy millions of acres of vacant
land and incorporate hundreds of thousands of new companies each year, spending1.5. THE NETWORK STATE IN ONE ESSAY 13
billions just to get that fresh start. And now that it is possible to start not just new
companies but new communities and even new currencies, we see people ﬂocking to
create those as well.
The societal value of a clean slate is also clear. In the technology sector alone, the
ability to form new companies has created trillions of dollars in wealth over the past
few decades. Indeed, if we imagine a world where you couldn’t just obtain a blank sheet
of paper but had to erase an older one, where you couldn’t just acquire bare land but
had to knock down a standing building, where you couldn’t just create a new company
but had to reform an existing ﬁrm, we imagine endless conﬂict over scarce resources.
Perhaps we don’t have to think too hard to imagine this world. It resembles our own.
In the distant past people could only write on clay tablets, in the recent past they were
executed for contemplating entrepreneurship, and in the immediate present they are
arguing over replacing an ancient gas station. In these times and places, making a fresh
start has been technologically infeasible, politically impossible, or judicially punishable.
Andthat’swherewearetodaywithcountries, cities, nations, governments, institutions,
and much of the physical world. Because the brand new is unthinkable, we ﬁght over
the old.
But perhaps we can change that.",494
5,"1.5.1 How to Start a New Country
There are at least six ways to start a new country; three are conventional and three
are unconventional. We will introduce them only to deprioritize them all in favor of a
seventh.
1. Election
The most conventional way to start a new country involves winning suﬃcient power
in an election to either (a) rewrite the laws of an existing state or (b) carve out a new
one from scratch with the recognition of the international community. This is the most
widely discussed path, and by far the most crowded — perhaps toocrowded.
2. Revolution
The second obvious way is a political revolution. We don’t advise attempting this.
Particularly momentous elections are sometimes referred to as revolutions, though a
revolution frequently involves bloodshed. Revolutions are infrequent, but everyone
knows that they mean a new government.
3. War
The third conventional way to form a new state is to win a war. We don’t advise
attempting this either. A war is, of course, not independent from the other two.14 CHAPTER 1. QUICKSTART
Indeed, both elections and revolutions can lead to wars that end up carving out new
polities. Like a revolution, a war is infrequent and undesirable, but is a means by which
to redraw state borders.
4. Micronations
Now we get to the unconventional. The most obvious of the unconventional approaches
– and the one most people think of when they hear the concept of “starting a new
country” – occurs when an eccentric plants a ﬂag on an oﬀshore platform or disputed
patch of dirt and declares themselves king of nothing. If the issue with elections is that
toomanypeople care about them, the issue with these so-called micronations is that
toofewpeople care. Because a state (like a currency) is an inherently social aﬀair, a
few people in the middle of nowhere won’t be able to organize a military, enforce laws,
or be recognized by other countries. Moreover, while an existing state may be content
to let people harmlesslyLARP a fake country in their backyard, an actual threat to
sovereignty typically produces a response with real guns, whether that be the Falklands
or Sakhalin.
5. Seasteading
Here is where things start to get interesting. Conceived by Patri Friedman and backed
by Peter Thiel, seasteading essentially starts with the observation that cruise ships
exist, and asks whether we could move from a few weeks on the water at a time to
semi-permanent habitation in international waters (with frequent docking, of course).
Ifthe costofcruiseshipsfalls, this approach becomesmore feasible. Butwhilethere are
individuals who live on cruise ships year-round, we haven’t yet seen a scaled example.
6. Space
Perhaps the most prestigious of the start-a-new-country paths is the idea of colonizing
other planets. Unlike seasteading or micronations, space exploration started at the
government level and has been glamorized in many movies and TV shows, so it enjoys
a higher degree of social acceptability. This path is typically received as temporarily
technically infeasible, rather than outright crazy. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is one entity
seriously contemplating the logistics of starting a new state on Mars.1.5. THE NETWORK STATE IN ONE ESSAY 15
7. Network States
Andﬁnallywearriveatourpreferredmethod: thenetworkstate. Ourideaistoproceed
cloud ﬁrst, land last. Rather than starting with the physical territory, we start with
the digital community. We create a startup society, organize it into a network union,
crowdfund the physical nodes of a network archipelago, and — in the fullness of time
— eventually negotiate for diplomatic recognition to become a true network state. We
build the embryonic state as an open-source project, we organize our internal economy
around remote work, we cultivate in-person levels of civility, we simulate architecture
in VR, and we create art and literature that reﬂects our values.
When we crowdfund territory in the real world, it’s not necessarily contiguous territory.
Because an under-appreciated fact is that the internet allows us to network enclaves .
Put another way, a network archipelago need not acquire all its territory in one place
at one time. It can connect a thousand apartments, a hundred houses, and a dozen cul-
de-sacs in diﬀerent cities into a new kind of fractal polity with its capital in the cloud.
Community members migrate between these enclaves and crowdfund territory nearby,
with every individual dwelling and group house presenting an independent opportunity
for expansion. And with a thousand such enclaves, rather than four directions to
expand (north, east, south, and west), there are more like four thousand.
What we’ve described thus far is much like an ethnic diaspora, in which emigrants are
internationally dispersed but connected by communication channels with each other
and the motherland. The twist is that our version is a reverse diaspora : a community
that forms ﬁrst on the internet, builds a culture online, and only then comes together
in-person to build dwellings and structures. In a sense, you can think of each physical
outpost of this digital community as a cloud embassy , similar to the grassroots Bitcoin
embassies that have arisen around the world to help people better understand Bitcoin.
New recruits can visit either the virtual or physical parts of a network state, beta test
it, and decide to leave or stay.
Now, with all this talk of embassies and countries one might well contend that network
states, like the aforementioned micronations, are also just a LARP. Unlike microna-
tions, however, they are set up to be a scaledLARP, a feat of imagination practiced
by large numbers of people at the same time. And the experience of cryptocurrencies
over the last decade shows us just how powerful such a shared LARP can be.",1349
6,"1.5.2 Minimum Necessary Innovation
Let’s pause and summarize for a second. The main diﬀerence between the seventh
method (network states) and the previous six (election, revolution, war, micronations,
seasteading, and space) is that the seventh straddles the boundary between practicality
and impracticality.
It is now feasible to build million-person online communities, start billion-dollar digital
currencies, and architect buildings in VR to then crowdfund into reality. The network
state concept stacks together many existing technologies, rather than requiring the16 CHAPTER 1. QUICKSTART
invention of new ones — like Mars-capable rockets, or permanent-habitation seasteads.
At the same time, it avoids the obvious pathways of election, revolution, and war – all
of which turn ugly, and none of which provide much venue for individual initiative.
In other words, the network state takes the most robust existing tech stack we have –
namely, the suite of technologies built around the internet – and uses it to route around
political roadblocks, without waiting for future physical innovation.",247
7,"1.5.3 What Counts as a New Country?
Having outlined these seven methods, the careful reader will notice that we have played
a bit fast and loose with the deﬁnition of what a “new country” is.
First, whatdowe meanbyanewcountry? Onedeﬁnitionisthatstartinganewcountry
means settling a wholly new territory, like colonizing Mars. Another deﬁnition is that
simply changing the form of government actually changes the country, like France
moving from the Second French Republic to the Second French Empire. Rather than
using either these strict or loose deﬁnitions, we will use both numerical andsocietal
deﬁnitions of a new country.
Thenumerical deﬁnitionbeginswithvisualizingahypothetical nationrealestatepop.com
site similar to coinmarketcap.com , which aggregates the cryptographically audited
censuses of startup societies aspiring to become network states. This dashboard would
showinrealtimethenumberofcommunitymembers,theacreageofrealestateownedby
those members, and the community’s on-chain income. A startup society with ﬁve mil-
lion people worldwide, thousands of square miles of (discontiguous) community-owned
land, and billions in annual income would have indisputable numerical signiﬁcance.
This in turn leads us to the societaldeﬁnition: a new country is one that is diplomati-
cally recognized by other countries as a legitimate polity capable of self-determination.
A state with enough such bilateral relationships would have the societal signiﬁcance
to gain accession to a group of pre-existing states like ASEAN, the OAS, the African
Union, the EU, or the United Nations.
This combination of numerical and societal metrics matches the emergence of cryp-
tocurrency. Initially ignored, then mocked as an obvious failure, within ﬁve years after
its invention Bitcoin attained a billion-dollar market capitalization (a numerical suc-
cess) and was subsequently listed on CNBC and Bloomberg alongside blue-chip stocks
(a form of societalrecognition). At each step Bitcoin could keep ascending numerically
on its own, with greater societal recognition following in its wake. By 2020 it had
changed the trajectory of the People’s Bank of China, the IMF, Goldman Sachs, JP
Morgan, and the World Bank. By 2021, Bitcoin became legal tender in El Salvador,
a sovereign state. And by mid-2022 the Central African Republic had followed, with
dozens more considering Bitcoin as legal tender, including Panama.1.5. THE NETWORK STATE IN ONE ESSAY 17",597
8,"1.5.4 Most Countries are Small Countries
Cryptocurrency could achieve these heights because money has both numerical and
societal aspects.The numbers could be piled up before the societal accolades followed.
Once Bitcoin had proven that it couldn’t be easily counterfeited or hacked, the shared
belief of the millions of cryptocurrency holders worldwide was enough to get BTC
from a value of zero to a market cap of billions, and from there to a listing on every
Bloomberg Terminal and exchange. Societal traction of this kind paved the way for
more numerical traction, and a virtuous cycle followed.
Could a startup society follow a similar path? Yes. A cryptographically auditable
censuscouldprovethatagrowingstartupsocietyhad1-10Mcommitteddigitalcitizens,
large cryptocurrency reserves, years of continuous existence, and physical holdings all
over the earth. That numerical traction could then be used to achieve the societal
traction of diplomatic recognition.
Why? Because most countries are small countries. A new state with a population of
1-10M would actually be comparable to most existing states. That’s because of the 193
UN-recognized sovereign states, 20% have a population of less than 1M and 55% have
a population of less than 10M. This includes many countries typically thought of as
legitimate, such as Luxembourg (615k), Cyprus (1.2M), Estonia (1.3M), New Zealand
(4.7M), Ireland (4.8M), and Singapore (5.8M). These “user counts” are surprisingly
small by tech standards!
Of course, mere quantity is not everything. The strength of aﬃliation to our hypo-
thetical network state matters, as does the time on the property, the percentage of net
worth stored in the currency, and the fraction of contacts found in the community.
Still, once we remember that Facebook has 3B+ users, Twitter has 300M+, and many18 CHAPTER 1. QUICKSTART
individual inﬂuencers have 1M+ followers, it starts to be not too crazy to imagine we
canbuilda1-10Mpersonstartupsocietywithagenuinesenseofnationalconsciousness,
an integrated cryptocurrency, and a plan to crowdfund many pieces of territory around
the world. With the internet, we can digitally sew these disjoint enclaves together into
a new kind of polity that achieves diplomatic recognition: a network state .",533
9,"2.1 Prologue
Our history is the prologue to the network state.
This isnotobvious. Founding a startup society as we’ve described it seems to be about
growing a community, writing code, crowdfunding land, and eventually attaining the
diplomatic recognition to become a network state. What does history have to do with
anything?
The short version is that if a tech company is about technological innovation ﬁrst, and
company culture second, a startup society is the reverse. It’s about community culture
ﬁrst, and technological innovation second. And while innovating on technology means
forecasting the future, innovating on culture means probing the past.
But why? Well, for a tech company like SpaceX you start with time-invariant laws of
physics extracted from data, laws that tell you how atoms collide andinteract with each
other. The study of these laws allows you to do something that has never been done
before, seemingly proving that history doesn’t matter. But the subtlety is that these
laws of physics encode in highly compressed form the results of innumerable scientiﬁc
experiments. You are learning from human experience rather than trying to re-derive
physical law from scratch. To touch Mars, we stand on the shoulders of giants.
For a startup society, we don’t yet have eternal mathematical laws for society.History
is the closest thing we have to a physics of humanity. It furnishes many accounts of how
human actors collide and interact with each other. The right course of historical study
encodes, in compressed form, the results of innumerable social experiments. You can
learn from human experience rather than re-deriving societal law from scratch. Learn
some history, so as not to repeat it.
1920 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
That’s a theoretical argument. An observational argument is that we know that the
technological innovation of the Renaissance began by rediscovering history. And we
knowthattheFoundingFatherscareddeeplyabouthistory. Inbothcases,theystepped
forward by drawing from the past. So if you’re a technologist looking to blaze a trail
with a new startup society, that establishes plausibility for why historical study is
important.
The logistical argument is perhaps the most compelling. Think about how much easier
it is to use an iPhone than it was to build Apple from scratch. To consume you can just
click a button, but to produce it’s necessary to know something about how companies
arebuilt. Similarly, it’sonethingtooperateasamerecitizenofapre-builtcountry, and
quite another thing to create one from scratch. To build a new society, it’d be helpful
to have some knowledge of how countries were built in the ﬁrst place, the logistics of
the process. And this again brings us into the domain of history.",637
10,"2.1.1 Why History is Crucial
You can’t really learn something without using it. One day of immersion with a new
language beats weeks of book learning. One day of trying to build something with a
programming language beats weeks of theory, too.
In the same way, the history we teach is an appliedhistory: a crucial tool for both
the prospective president of a startup societyand for their citizens, shareholders, and
staﬀ. It’s something you’ll use on a daily basis. Why?
•History is how you win the argument. Think about the 1619 Project, or the
grievance studies departments at universities, or even a newspaper “proﬁle” of
some unfortunate. You might be mining cryptocurrency, but the folks behind
such things are mining history. That is, many thousands of people are engaged
full time in “oﬀense archaeology,” the excavation of the recent and distant past
for some useful incident they can write up to further demoralize their political
opposition. This is the scholarly version of going through someone’s old tweets.
It’s weaponized history, history as opposition research. You simply can’t win an
argument against such people on pure logic alone; you need facts, so you need
history.
•History determines legality. Wedenotetheexponentialimprovementintransistor
density over the postwar period by Moore’s law. We describe the exponential
declinein pharmaceutical R&D eﬃciency during the same period as Eroom’s
law — as Moore’s law in reverse. That is, over the last several decades, the FDA2.1. PROLOGUE 21
somehow presided over an enormous hike in the costs of drug development even as
our computers and our knowledge of the human genome vastly improved. Similar
phenomena can be observed in energy (where energy production has stagnated),
in aviation (where top speeds have topped out), and in construction (where we
build slower today than we did seventy years ago).
Obviously, even articulating Eroom’s law requires detailed knowledge of history,
knowledge of how things used to be. Less obviously, if we want to change Eroom’s
law, if we want to innovate in the physical world again, we’ll need history too.
The reason is that behind every FDA is a thalidomide, just as behind every TSA
there’s a 9/11 and behind every Sarbanes-Oxley is an Enron. Regulation is dull,
but the incidents that lead to regulation are anything but dull.
This history is used to defend ancient regulations; if you change them, people
will die! As such, to legalize physical innovation you’ll need to become a counter-
historian. Only when you understand the legitimating history of regulatory agen-
cies better than their proponents do can you build a superior alternative: a new
regulatory paradigm capable of addressing both the abuses of the American reg-
ulatory state andthe abuses they claim to prevent.
•History determines morality. Religions start with history lessons. You might
think of these as made-up histories, but they’re histories all the same. Tales of
the distant past, ﬁctionalized or not, that describe how humans once behaved -
and how they should have behaved. There’s a moral to these stories.
Political doctrines are based on history lessons too. They’re how the establish-
ment justiﬁes itself. The mechanism for propagating these history lessons is the
establishment newspaper, wherein most articles aren’t really about true-or-false,
but good-and-bad. Try it yourself. Just by glancing at a headline from any es-
tablishment outlet, you can instantly apprehend its moral lesson: x-ism is bad,
our system of government is good, tech founders are bad, and so on. And if you
poke one level deeper, if you ask whyany of these things is good or bad, you’ll
again get a history lesson. Because why is x-ism bad? Well, let me educateyou
on some history...
The installation of these moral premises is a zero-sum game. There’s only room
for so many moral lessons in one society, because a brain’s capacity for moral
computation is limited. So you get a totally diﬀerent society if 99% of people
allocate their limited moral memory to principles like “hard work good, meri-
tocracy good, envy bad, charity good” than if 99% of people have internalized
nostrums like “socialism good, civility bad, law enforcement bad, looting good.”
You can try to imagine a scenario where these two sets of moral values aren’t in
direct conﬂict, but empirically those with the ﬁrst set of moral values will favor22 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
an entrepreneurial society and those with the second set of values will not.
•History is how you develop compelling media. You can make up entirely ﬁctional
stories, of course. But even ﬁction frequently has some kind of historical an-
tecedent. The Lord of the Rings drew on Medieval Europe, Spaghetti Westerns
pulled from the Wild West, Bond movies were inspired by the Cold War, and
so on. And certainly the legitimating stories for any political order will draw on
history.
•History is the true value of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is worth hundreds of billions
of dollars because it’s a cryptographically veriﬁable history of who holds what
BTC. Read The Truth Machine for a book-length treatment of this concept.
•History tells you who’s in charge. Why did Orwell say that he who controls the
past controls the future, and that he who controls the present controls the past?
Because history textbooks are written by the winners. They are authored, sub-
tly or not, to tell a story of great triumph by the ruling establishment over its
past enemies. The only history most people in the US know is 1776, 1865, 1945,
and 1965 - a potted history of revolutions, world wars, and activist movements
that lead ineluctably to the sunny uplands of greater political equality.It’s very
similar to the history the Soviets taught their children, where all of the past
was interpreted through the lens of class struggle, bringing Soviet citizens to the
present day where they were inevitably progressing from the intermediate stage
of socialism towards...communism! Chinese schoolchildren learn a similarly se-
lective history where the (real) wrongs of the European colonialists and Japanese
are centered, and those of Mao downplayed. And even any successful startup
tells a founding story that sands oﬀ the rough edges.
Inshort, ahistorytextbookgivesyouahero’sjourneythatcelebratesthetriumph
of its establishment authors against all odds. Even when a historical treatment
covers ostensible victims, like Soviet textbooks covering the victimization of the
proletariat, if you look carefully the ruling class that authors that treatment
typically justiﬁes itself as the champion of those victims. This is why one of the
ﬁrst acts of any conquering regime is to rewrite the textbooks (click those links),
to tell you who’s in charge.
•History determines your hiring policy. Why are tech companies being lectured by
mediacorporationson“diversity”? Isitbecausethosemediacorporationsthatare
20-30 points whiter than tech companies actually deeply care about this? Or is
it because after the 2009-era collapse of print media revenue, media corporations
struggled for a business model, found that certain words drove traﬃc, and then
doubled down on that - boosting their stock price and bashing their competitors2.1. PROLOGUE 23
in the process?After all, if you know a bit morehistory, you’ll know that the
New York Times Company (which originates so many of these jeremiads) is an
organization where the controlling Ochs-Sulzberger family literally proﬁted from
slavery, blocked women from being publishers, excluded gays from the newsroom
for decades, ran a succession process featuring only three cis straight white male
cousins, and ended up with a publisher who just happened to be the son of the
previous guy.
Suppose you’re a founder. Once you know this history, and once all your friends
and employees and investors know it, and once you know that no purportedly

•History is how you debug our broken society. Many billions of dollars are spent
on history in the engineering world. We don’t think about it that way, though.
We call it doing a post-mortem, looking over the log ﬁles, maybe running a so-
called time-travel debugger to get a reproducible bug. Once we ﬁnd it, we might
want to execute an undo, do a git revert , restore from backup, or return to a
previously known-good conﬁguration.
Think about what we’re saying: on a micro-scale, knowing the detailed past of the
system allows us to ﬁgure out what had gone wrong. And being able to partially
rewindthe past to progress along a diﬀerent branch (via a git revert ) empow-24 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
ers us to ﬁx that wrongness. This doesn’t mean throwing away everything and
returning to the caveman era of a blank git repository, as per either the carica-
tured traditionalist who wants to “turn back the clock” or the anarcho-primitivist
who wants to end industrialized civilization. But it does mean rewinding a bit to
then move forward along a diﬀerent path, because progress has both magnitude
anddirection . All these concepts apply to debugging situations at larger scale
than companies — like societies, or countries.
You now see why history is useful. A founder of a mere startup company can arguably
scrape by without it, tacitly outsourcing the study of history to those who shape
society’s laws and morality. But a president of a startup society cannot, because a new
society involves moral, social, and legal innovation relative to the old one — and that
requires a knowledge of history.",533
12,"2.1.2 Why History is Crucial for Startup Societies
We’ve whetted the appetite with some speciﬁc examples of why history is useful in
general. Now we’ll describe why it’s speciﬁcally useful for startup societies.
We begin by introducing an operationally useful set of tools for thinking about the
past from a bottom-up and top-down perspective: history as written to the ledger, as
opposed to history as written by the winners.
We use these tools to discuss the emergence of a new Leviathan, the Network, a con-
tender for the most powerful force in the world, a true peer (and complement) to both
God and the State as a mechanism for social organization.
And then we’ll bring it all together in the lead-up to the key concept of this chapter:
the idea of the One Commandment, a historically-founded sociopolitical innovation
that draws citizens to a startup society just as a technologically-based commercial
innovation attracts customers to a startup company.
Ifastartupbeginsbyidentifyinganeconomicproblemintoday’smarketandpresenting
a technologically-informed solution to that problem in the form of a new company, a
startup society begins by identifying a moral issue in today’s culture and presenting a
historically-informed solution to that issue in the form of a new society.",306

tech-focused community where people solve problems with equations? We’re interested
in Mars and life extension, not dusty stories of defunct cities!
The quick answer comes from Paul Johnson at the 11:00 mark of this talk, where he
notes that early America’s religious colonies succeeded at a higher rate than its for-
proﬁt colonies, because the former had a purpose. The slightly longer answer is that
in a startup society, you’re not asking people to buya product (which is an economic,
individualistic pitch) but to joina community (which is a cultural, collective pitch).
You’re arguing that the culture of your startup society is better than the surrounding
culture; implicitly, that means there’s some moral deﬁcit in the world that you’re ﬁxing.
History comes into play because you’ll need to (a) write a study of that moral deﬁcit
and (b) draw from the past to ﬁnd alternative social arrangements where that moral
deﬁcit did not occur. Tech may be part of the solution, and calculations may well be
involved, but the moment you write about any societal problem in depth you’ll ﬁnd
yourself writing a historyof that problem.

disbelief for a little bit, keep reading, and trust us that this historical/moral/ethical
angle just might be the missing ingredient to build startup societies, which after all
haven’t yet fully taken oﬀ in the modern world.",433
14,"2.1.4 Applied History for Startup Societies
Here’s the outline of this chapter.
1. We start with bottom-up history. The section on Microhistory and Macrohistory
bridges the gap between the trajectory of an isolated, reproducible system and
the trajectories of millions of interacting human beings. Because both these small
and large-scale trajectories can now be digitally recorded and quantiﬁed, this is
history as written to the ledger — culminating in the cryptohistory of Bitcoin.
2. We next discuss top-down history. This is history as written by the winners,
history as conceptualized by what Tyler Cowen calls the Base-Raters, history
that justiﬁes the current order and proclaims it stable and inevitable. It is a
theory of Political Power vs. Technological Truth .
3. We then talk about the history of power, giving names to the forces we just de-
scribed by identifying the three candidates for most powerful force in the world:
God, State, and Network . Framing things in terms of threeprime movers rather
than one allows us to generalize beyond purely God-centered religions to under-
stand the Leviathan-centered doctrines that implicitly underpin modern society.
4. We apply this to the history of power struggles. With the God/State/Network
lens, we can understand the Blue/Red and Tech-vs-Media conﬂicts in a diﬀerent
way as a multi-sided struggle between People of God, People of the State, and
People of the Network .
5. We go through how the People of the State have used their power to distort recent26 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
and distant history, and how the Network is newly rectifying this distortion in
“If the News is Fake, Imagine History.”
6. Having shown the degree to which history has been distorted, and thereby dis-
placed the (implicit) historical narrative in which the arc of history bends to the
ineluctable victory of the US establishment, we discuss several alternative theo-
ries of past and future in our section on Fragmentation, Frontier, Fourth Turning,
and Future Is Our Past . These theses don’t describe a clean progressive victory
oneveryaxis, butinsteadasetofcycles, hairpinturns, andmirrorimages, asetof
historical trajectories far more complex than the narrative of linear inevitability
smuggled in through textbooks and mass media.
7. We next turn our attention to left and right, which are confusing concepts in
a realigning time, in Left is the new Right is the new Left . Sorry! We can’t
avoid politics anymore. Startup societies aren’t purely about technology. But
please note that for the most part this section isn’tthe same old pabulum around
current events. We do contend that you need a theory of left and right to build
a startup society, but that doesn’t mean just picking a side.
Why? While a political consumer has to pick one of a few party platforms oﬀ
the menu, a political founder can do something diﬀerent: ideology construction.
To inform this, we’ll show how left and right have swapped sides through history,
and how any successful mass movement has botha revolutionary left component
and a ruling right component.
8. Finally, all of this builds up to the payoﬀ: the One Commandment . Using the
terminology we just introduced, we can rattle it oﬀ in a few paragraphs. (If the
following is opaque in any way, read the chapter, then come back and re-read this
part.)
If history is not pre-determined to bend in one direction, if the current establish-
ment may experience dramatic disruption in the form of the Fragmentation and
Fourth Turning , if its power actually arose from the expanding frontier rather
than the expanding franchise, if history is somehow running in reverse as per
theFuture Is Our Past thesis, if the revolutionary and ruling classes are in fact
switching sides, if the new Leviathan that is the Network is indeed rising above
the State, and if the internal American conﬂicts can be seen not as policy dis-
putes but as holy wars, as clashes of Leviathans...then the assumption of the
Base-Raters that all will proceed as it always has is quite incorrect! But rather
than admit this incorrectness, they’ll attempt to use political power to suppress
technological truth.2.1. PROLOGUE 27
The founder’s counter is cryptohistory and the startup society. We now have
a history no establishment can easily corrupt, the cryptographically veriﬁable
history pioneered by Bitcoin and extended via crypto oracles. We also have a
theory of historical feasibility , history as a trajectory rather than an inevitability,
the idea that the desirable future will only occur if you put in individual eﬀort.
But what exactly is the nature of that desirable future?
After all, many groups diﬀer with the old order but also with each other — so a
blanket solution won’t work. And could well be resisted. That’s where the One
Commandment comes in.
As context, the modern person is often morally reticent but politically evange-
listic. They hesitate to talk about what is moral or immoral, because it’s not
their place to say what’s right. Yet when it comes to politics, this diﬃdence is
frequently replaced by overbearing conﬁdence in how others must live, coupled
with an enthusiasm for enforcing their beliefs at gunpoint if necessary.
In between this zero and 1, in between eschewing moral discussion entirely and
imposing a full-blown political doctrine, in this ﬁnal section we propose a one: a
one commandment. Start a new society with its own moral code, based on your
study of history, and recruit people that agree with you to populate it.We’re
not saying you need to come up with your own new Ten Commandments, mind
you — but you do need One Commandment to establish the diﬀerentiation of a
new startup society.
Concrete examples of possible One Commandments include “24/7 internet bad”
(which leads to a Digital Sabbath society), or “carbs bad” (which leads to a Keto
Kosher society), or “traditional Christianity good” (which leads to a Benedict
Option society), or “life extension good” (which leads to a post-FDA society).
You might think these One Commandments sound either trivial or unrealistically
ambitious, but in that respect they’re similar to tech; the pitch of “140 charac-
ters” sounded trivial and the pitch of “reusable rockets” seemed unrealistic, but
those resulted in Twitter and SpaceX respectively. The One Commandment is
also similar to tech in another respect: it focusesa startup society on a single
moral innovation, just like a tech company is about a focusedtechnoeconomic
innovation.
That is, as we’ll see, each One Commandment-based startup society is premised
on deconstructing the establishment’s history in one speciﬁc area, erecting a re-
placement narrative in its place with a new One Commandment, then provingthe
socioeconomic value of that One Commandment by using it to attract subscriber-
citizens. For example, if you can attract 100k subscribers to your Keto Kosher
society through deeply researched historical studies on the obesity epidemic, and
then show that they’ve lost signiﬁcant weight as a consequence, you’ve proven28 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
the establishment deeply wrong in a key area. That’ll either drive them to reform
— ornotreform, in which case you attract more citizens.
Akeypointisthatwecanapplyallthetechniquesofstartupcompaniestostartup
societies. Financing, attracting subscribers, calculating churn, doing customer
support — there’s a playbook for all of that. It’s just Society-as-a-Service, the
new SaaS.
In parallel, other startup societies are likewise critiquing by building, draining
citizens away from the establishment with their own historically-informed One
Commandments, and thereby driving change on other dimensions. Finally, dif-
ferent successful changes can be copied and merged together, such that the sec-
ond generation of startup societies starts diﬀerentiating from the establishment
by two, three, or Ncommandments. This is a vision for peaceful, parallelized,
historically-driven reform of a broken society.
Ok! I know those last few paragraphs involved some heavy sledding, but come back
and reread them after going through the chapter. The main point of our little preview
here was to make the case that history is an applied",1992
15,"subject — and that you can’t start
a new society without it.

faithfully recorded, history is then just the analysis of the log ﬁles. To understand this
view we’ll discuss the idea of history as a trajectory. Then we’ll introduce the concepts
of microhistory and macrohistory, by analogy to microeconomics and macroeconomics.
Finally, we’ll unify all this with the new concept of cryptohistory.",117
17,"2.2.1 History as a Cryptic Epic of Twisting Trajectories
What happens when you propel an object into the air? The ﬁrst thing that comes to
mind is the trajectory of a ball. Throw it and witness its arc. Just a simple parabola,
an exercise in freshman physics. But there are more complicated trajectories.
•A boomerang ﬂies forward and comes back to the origin.
•Achargedparticleinaconstantmagneticﬁeldissubjecttoaforceatrightangles,
and moves in a circle.
•Arocketwithsuﬃcientfuelcanescapetheearth’satmosphereratherthancoming
back down.
•A curveball, subject to the Magnus eﬀect, can twist in mid-air en route to its
destination.
•A projectile launched into a suﬃciently thick gelatin decelerates without ever
hitting the ground.
•A powered drone can execute an arbitrarily complicated ﬂight path, mimicking
that of a bumblebee or helix.
So, how a system evolves with time — its trajectory — can be complex and counter-
intuitive, even for something small. This is a good analogy for history. If the ﬂight
path of a single inanimate object can be this surprising, think about the dynamics of
a massive multi-agent system of highly animate people. Imagine billions of humans
springing up on the map, forming clusters, careening into each other, creating more
humans, and throwing oﬀ petabytes of data exhaust the whole way. That’s history.
And the timeframes involved make it tough to study. The rock you throw into the air
doesn’t take decades to play out its ﬂight path. Humans do. So a historical observer
can literally die before seeing the consequences of an action.
Moreover, the subjects of the study don’t wantto be studied. A mere rock isn’t a
stealth bomber. It has neither the motive nor the means to deceive you about its ﬂight
path. Humans do. The people under the microscope are fogging the lens.
So: the scale is huge, the timeframe is long, and the measurements aren’t just noisy
but intentionally corrupted.30 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
We can encode all of this into a phrase: history is a cryptic epic of twisting trajectories .
Cryptic, because the narrators are unreliable and often intentionally misleading. Epic,
because the timescales are so long that you have to consciously sample beyond your
own experience and beyond any human lifetime to see patterns. Twisting, because
there are curves, cycles, collapses, and non-straightforward patterns. And trajectories,
because history is ultimately about the time evolution of human beings, which maps to
the physical idea of a dynamical system, of a set of particles progressing through time.
Put that together, and it wipes out both the base-rater’s view that today’s order will
remain basically stable over the short-term, and the complementary view of a long-term
“the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” It also contests
the idea that the fall of the bourgeoisie “and the victory of the proletariat are equally
inevitable,” or that “no two countries on a Bitcoin standard will go to war with each
other,” or even that technological progress has been rapid, so we can assume it will
continue and society will not collapse.
Those phrases come from diﬀerent ideologies, but each of them verbally expresses the
clean parabolic arc of the rock. History isn’t really like that at all. It’s much more
complicated. There are certainly trends, and those phrases do identify real trends, but
there is also pushback to those trends, counterforces that arise in response to applied
forces, syntheses that form from theses and antitheses, and outright collapses. Complex
dynamics, in other words.
And how do we study complex dynamical systems? The ﬁrst task is to measure.",911
18,"2.2.2 Microhistory is the History of Reproducible Systems
Microhistory is the history of a reproducible system, one which has few enough vari-
ables that it can be reset and replayed from the beginning in a series of controlled
experiments. It is history as a quantitative trajectory, history as a precise log of mea-
surements. For example, it could be the record of all past values of a state space vector
in a dynamical system, the account of all moves made by two deterministic algorithms
playing chess against each other, or the chronicle of all instructions executed by a
journaling ﬁle system after being restored to factory settings.
Microhistory is an applied subject, where accurate historical measurement is of di-
rect technical and commercial importance. We can see this with technologies like the
Kalman ﬁlter, which was used for steering the spaceship used in the moon landing.
You can see the full technical details here, but roughly speaking the Kalman ﬁlter uses
past measurements x[t 1];x[t 2];x[t 3]to inform the estimate of a system’s current
statex[t], the action that should be taken u[t], and the corresponding prediction of the
future state x[t+ 1]should that action be taken. For example, it uses past velocity,
direction headings, fuel levels, and the like to recommend how a space shuttle should be
steered at the current timestep. Crucially, if the microhistory is not accurate enough, if
the conﬁdence intervals around each measurement are too wide, or if (say) the velocity
estimate is wrong altogether, then the Kalman Filter does not work and Apollo doesn’t2.2. MICROHISTORY AND MACROHISTORY 31
happen.
At a surface level, the Kalman ﬁlter resembles the kind of time series analysis that’s
common in ﬁnance. The key diﬀerence is that the Kalman ﬁlter is used on reproducible
systemswhileﬁnanceistypicallya non-reproducible system. Ifyou’reusingtheKalman
ﬁlter to guide a drone from point A to point B, but you have a bug in your code and
the drone crashes, you can simply pick up the drone, put it back on the launch pad
at point A, and try again. Because you can repeat the experiment over and over, you
can eventually get very precise measurements and a functioning guidance algorithm.
That’s a reproducible system.
In ﬁnance, however, you usually can’t just keep re-running a trading algorithm that
makes money and get the same result. Eventually your counterparties will adapt and
get wise. A key diﬀerence relative to our drone example is the presence of animate
objects (other humans) who won’t always do the same thing given the same input.
In fact, they can often be adversarial, observing and reacting to your actions, inten-
tionally confounding your predictions, especially if they can proﬁt from doing so. Past
performance is no guarantee of future results in ﬁnance, as opposed to physics. Unlike
the situation with the drone, a market isn’t a reproducible system.
Microhistory thus has its limits, but it’s an incredibly powerful concept. If we have
good enough measurements on the past, then we have a better prediction of the future
in an extremely literal sense. If we have tight conﬁdence intervals on our measurements
of the past, if the probability distribution P(x[t 1])is highly peaked, then we get
correspondingly tight conﬁdence intervals on the present P(x[t])and the future P(x[t+
1]). Conversely, themoreuncertaintyaboutyourpast, themoreconfusedyouareabout
where you’re from and where you’re going, the more likely your rocket will crash. It’s
Orwell more literally than he ever expected: he who controls the past controls the
future, in the direct sense that he has better control theory. Only a civilization with a
strong capacity for accurate microhistory could ever make it to the moon.
This is a powerful analogy for civilization. A group of people who doesn’t know who
they are or where they came from won’t ever make it to the moon, let alone to Mars.
Can we make it more than an analogy?",1001

Macrohistory is the history of a non-reproducible system, one which has too many
variables to easily be reset and replayed from the beginning. It is history that is not32 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
directly amenable to controlled experiment. At small scale, that’s the unpredictable
ﬂow of a turbulent ﬂuid; at very large scale, it’s the history of humanity.
We think of macrohistory as being on a continuum with microhistory. Why? We’ll
make a few points and then tie them all together.
•First, science progresses by taking phenomena formerly thought of as non-
reproducible (and hence unpredictable) systems, isolating the key variables, and
turning them into reproducible (and hence predictable) systems. For example,
Koch’s postulates include the idea of transmission pathogenesis, which turned
the vague concept of infection via “miasma” into a reproducible phenomenon: ex-
pose a mouse to a speciﬁc microorganism in a laboratory setting and an infection
arises, but not otherwise.
•Second, and relatedly, science progresses by improved instrumentation, by better
recordkeeping. Star charts enabled celestial navigation. Johann Balmer’s doc-
umentation of the exact spacing of hydrogen’s emission spectra led to quantum
mechanics. Gregor Mendel’s careful counting of pea plants led to modern genet-
ics. Things we counted as simply beyond human ken — the stars, the atom, the
genome — became things humans can comprehend by simply counting.
•Third, how do we even know anything about the history of ancient Rome or
Egypt or Medieval Europe? From artifacts and written records. Thousands of
years ago, people were scratching customer reviews into a stone tablet, one of the
ﬁrst tablet-based apps. We know who Abelard and Heloise were from their letters
to each other. We know what the Romans were like from what they recorded. To
a signiﬁcant extent, what we know about history is what we’ve recovered from
what people wrote down.
•Fourth, today, we have digital documentation on an unprecedented scale. We
have billions of people using social media each day for almost a decade now.
We also have billions of phones taking daily photographs and videos. We have
countless data feeds of instruments. And we have massive hard drives to store it
all. So, if reckoned on the basis of raw bytes, we likely record more information
in a day than all of humanity recorded up to the year 1900. It is by far the most
comprehensive log of human activity we’ve ever had.
We can now see the continuumbetween macrohistory and microhistory. We are col-
lecting the kinds of precise, quantitative, microhistorical measurements that typically
led to the emergence of a new science...but at the scale of billions of people, and going
into our second decade.2.2. MICROHISTORY AND MACROHISTORY 33
So, another term for “Big Data” should be “Big History.” All data is a record of
past events, sometimes the immediate past, sometimes the past of months or years
ago, sometimes (in the case of Google Books or the Digital Michelangelo project) the
past of decades or centuries ago. After all, what’s another word for data storage in a
computer? Memory. Memory, as in the sense of human memory, and as in the sense
of history.
That memory is commercially valuable. A technologist who neglects history ensures
their users will get exploited. Proof? Consider reputation systems. Any scaled market-
place has them. The historyof an Uber driver or rider’s on-platform behavior partially
predicts their future behavior. Without years of star ratings, without memories of past
actions of millions of people, these platforms would be wrecked by fraud. Macrohistory
makes money.
This is just one example. There are huge short and long-term incentives to record all
this data, all this microhistory and macrohistory. And future historianswill study
our digital log to understand what we were like as a civilization.",948
20,"2.2.4 Bitcoin’s Blockchain Is a Technology for Robust Macro-

There are some catches to the concept of digital macrohistory, though: silos, bots,
censors, and fakes. As we’ll show, Bitcoin and its generalizations provide a powerful
way to solve these issues.
First, let’s understand the problems of silos, bots, censors, and fakes. The macrohis-
torical log is largely siloed across diﬀerent corporate servers, on the premises of Twitter
and Facebook and Google. The posts are typically not digitally signed or cryptograph-
ically timestamped, so much of the content is (or could be) from bots rather than
humans. Inconvenient digital history can be deleted by putting suﬃcient pressure on
centralized social media companies or academic publishers, censoring true information
in the name of taking down “disinformation,” as we’ve already seen. And the advent
of AI allows highly realistic fakes of the past and present to be generated. If we’re not
careful, we could drown in fake data.
So, how could someone in the future (or even the present) know if a particular event
they didn’t directly observe was real? The Bitcoin blockchain gives one answer. It is
the most rigorous form of history yet known to man, a history that is technically and
economicallyresistanttorevision. Thankstoacombinationofcryptographicprimitives
and ﬁnancial incentives, it is very challenging to falsify the who, what, and when of
transactions written to the Bitcoin blockchain.
Who initiated this transfer, what amount of Bitcoin did they send, what metadata
did they attach to the transaction, and when did they send it? That information is
recorded in the blockchain and suﬃcient to give a bare bones history of the entire34 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Bitcoin economy since 2009. And if you sum up that entire history to the present day,
you also get the values of how much BTC is held by each address. It’s an immediatist
model of history, where the past is not even past - it’s with us at every second.
In a little more detail, whyis the Bitcoin blockchain so resistant to the rewriting
of history? To falsify the “who” of a single transaction you’d need to fake a digital
signature, to falsify the “what” you’d need to break a hash function, to falsify the
“when” you’dneedtocorruptatimestamp, andyou’dneedtodothiswhilesomehownot
breaking all the other records cryptographically connected to that transaction through
the mechanism of composed block headers.
Some call the Bitcoin blockchain a timechain , because unlike many other blockchains,
its proof-of-work mechanism and diﬃculty adjustment ensure a statistically regular
time interval between blocks, crucial to its function as a digital history.
(I recognize that these concepts and some of what follows is technical. Our whirlwind
tourmayprovokeeitherfamiliarhead-noddingorconfusedhead-scratching. Ifyouwant
more detail, we’ve linked deﬁnitions of each term, but fully explaining them is beyond
the scope of this work. However, see The Truth Machine for a popular treatment and
Dan Boneh’s Cryptography course for technical detail.)
Nevertheless, here’s the point for even a nontechnical reader: the Bitcoin blockchain
gives ahistory that’s hard to falsify . Unless there’s an advance in quantum computing,
abreakthroughinpuremath, aheretoforeunseenbuginthecode, orahighlyexpensive
51% attack that probably only China could muster, it is essentially infeasible to rewrite
the history of the Bitcoin blockchain — or anything written to it. And even if such
an event doeshappen, it wouldn’t be an instantaneous burning of Bitcoin’s Library
of Alexandria. The hash function could be replaced with a quantum-safe version, or
another chain robust to said attack could take Bitcoin’s place, and back up the ledger
of all historical Bitcoin transactions to a new protocol.
With that said, we are not arguing that Bitcoin is infallible. We are arguing that it
is the best technology yet invented for recording human history. And if the concept
of cryptocurrency can endure past the invention of quantum decryption, we will likely
think of the beginning of cryptographically veriﬁable history as on par with the begin-
ning of written history millennia ago. Future societies may think of the year 2022 AD
as the year 13 AS, with “After Satoshi” as the new “Anno Domini,” and the block clock
as the new universal time.",1075
21,"2.2.5 The Bitcoin Blockchain Can Record Non-Bitcoin Events
For the price of a single transaction, the Bitcoin blockchain can be generalized to
provideacryptographicallyveriﬁablerecordofanyhistoricalevent, a proof-of-existence .
For example, perhaps there is some oﬀ-chain event of signiﬁcant importance where you
want to store it for the record. Suppose it’s the famous photo of Stalin with his cronies,
because you anticipate the rewriting of history. The proof-of-existence technique we’re2.2. MICROHISTORY AND MACROHISTORY 35
about to describe wouldn’t directly be able to prove the dataof the ﬁle was real, but
you could establish the metadata on the ﬁle — the who, what, and when — to a future
observer.
Speciﬁcally, given a proof-of-existence, a future observer would be able to conﬁrm that
a given digital signature (who) put a given hash of a photo (what) on chain at a given
time (when). That future observer might well suspect the photo could still be fake, but
they’d know it’d have to be faked at that precise time by the party controlling that
wallet. And the evidence would be on-chain years before the airbrushed oﬃcial photo
of Stalin was released. That’s implausible under many models. Who’d fake something
so speciﬁc years in advance? It’d be more likely the oﬃcial photo was fake than the
proof-of-existence.
So, let’s suppose that this limited level of proof was worth it to you. You are willing
to pay such that future generations can see an indelible record of a bit of history. How
would you get that proof onto the Bitcoin blockchain?
The way you’d do this is by organizing your arbitrarily large external dataset (a photo,
or something much larger than that) into a Merkle tree, calculating a string of ﬁxed
length called a Merkle root, and then writing that to the Bitcoin blockchain through
OP_RETURN . This furnishes a tool for proof-of-existence for any digital ﬁle.
You can do this as a one-oﬀ for a single piece of data, or as a periodic backup for any
non-Bitcoin chain. So you could, in theory, put a digital summary of many gigabytes
of data from another chain on the Bitcoin blockchain every ten minutes for the price
of a single BTC transaction, thereby proving it existed. This would eﬀectively “back
up” this other blockchain and give it some of the irreversibility properties of Bitcoin.
Call this kind of chain a subchain.
By analogy to the industrial use of gold, this type of “industrial” use case of a Bitcoin
transaction may turn out to be quite important. A subchain with many millions of oﬀ-
Bitcoin transactions every ten minutes could likely generate enough economic activity
to easily pay for a single Bitcoin transaction.36 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
And as more people try to use the Bitcoin blockchain, given its capacity limits, it might
turn out that onlyindustrial use cases like this could aﬀord to pay suﬃcient fees in this
manner, as direct individual use of the Bitcoin blockchain could become expensive.
So, that means we can use the proof-of-existence technique to log arbitrary data to the
Bitcoin blockchain, including data from other chains.",801
22,"2.2.6 Blockchains Can Record the History of an Economy and

We just zoomed in to detail how you’d log a single transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain
to prove any given historical event happened. Now let’s zoom out.
As noted, the full scope of what the Bitcoin blockchain represents is nothing less than
the history of an entire economy. Every transaction is recorded since t= 0. Every
fractionofaBTCisaccountedfor, downtoonehundredmillionthofaBitcoin. Nothing
is lost.
Except, of course, for all the oﬀ-chain data that accompanies a transaction - like the
identity of the sender and receiver, the reason for their transaction, the SKU of any
goods sold, and so on. There are usually good reasons for these things to remain
private, or partially private, so you might think this is a feature.
The problem is that Bitcoin’s design is a bit of a tweener, as it doesn’t actually ensure
that public transactions remain private. Indeed there are companies like Elliptic and
Chainalysis devoted entirely to the deanonymization of public Bitcoin addresses and
transactions. The right model of the history of the Bitcoin economy is that it’s in
a hybrid state, where the public has access to the raw transaction data, but private
actors (like Chainalysis and Elliptic) have access to much more information and can
deanonymize many transactions.
Moreover, Bitcoin can onlyexecute Bitcoin transactions, rather than all the other kinds
of digital operations you could facilitate with more blockspace. But people are working
on all of this.
•Zero-knowledgetechnologylikeZCash, Ironﬁsh, andTornadoCashallowon-chain

•Smart contract chains like Ethereum and Solana extend the capability of what
can be done on chain, at the expense of higher complexity.
•Decentralized social networks like Mirror and DeSo put social events on chain
alongside ﬁnancial transactions.
•NamingsystemsliketheEthereumNameService(ENS)andSolanaNameService

•Incorporation systems allow the on-chain representation of corporate abstrac-

programmable company-equivalents like DAOs.
•Newprooftechniqueslikeproof-of-solvencyandproof-of-locationextendthesetof

of Bitcoin.
•Cryptocredentials, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Non-Transferable Fungibles
(NTFs), and Soulbounds allow the representation of non-ﬁnancial data on chain,
like diplomas or endorsements.
What’s the point? If blockspace continues to increase, ever more of the digital history
of our economy and society will be recorded on chain, in a cryptographically veriﬁable
yet privacy-preserving way. The analogy is to the increase in bandwidth, which now
allows us to download a megabyte of JavaScript on a mobile phone to run a webapp,
an unthinkable indulgence in the year 2000.
This is a breakthrough in digital macrohistory that addresses the issues of silos, bots,
censors, and fakes. Public blockchains aren’t siloed in corporations, but publicly acces-
sible. Theyprovidenewtools, likestakingandENS-styleidentity, thatallowseparation
of bots from humans. They can incorporate many diﬀerent proof techniques, including
proof-of-existence and more, to address the problem of deepfakes. And they can have
very strong levels of censorship resistance by paying transaction fees to hash their chain
state to the Bitcoin blockchain.",883
23,"2.2.7 Cryptohistory is Cryptographically Veriﬁable Macrohis-

We can now see how the expansion of blockspace is on track to give us a cryptographi-
cally veriﬁable macrohistory , or cryptohistory for short.
This is the log of everything that billions of people choose to make public: every
decentralized tweet, every public donation, every birth and death certiﬁcate, every
marriage and citizenship record, every crypto domain registration, every merger and
acquisition of an on-chain entity, every ﬁnancial statement, every public record — all
digitally signed, timestamped, and hashed in freely available public ledgers.38 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
The thing is, essentially all of human behavior has a digital component now. Every
purchase and communication, every ride in an Uber, every swipe of a keycard, and
every step with a Fitbit — all of that produces digital artifacts.
So, in theory you could eventually download the public blockchain of a network state to
replay the entire cryptographically veriﬁed history of a community.That’s the future
of public records, a concept that is to the paper-based system of the legacy state what
paper records were to oral records.
It’s also a vision for what macrohistory will become. Not a scattered letter from an
Abelard here and a stone tablet from an Egyptian there. But a full log, a cryptohis-
tory. The uniﬁcation of microhistory and macrohistory in one giant cryptographically
veriﬁable dataset. We call this indelible, computable, digital, authenticatable history
theledger of record .
This concept is foundational to the network state. And it can be used for good or ill.
In decentralized form, the ledger of record allows an individual to resist the Stalinist
rewriting of the past. It is the ultimate expression of the bottom-up view of history
as what’s written to the ledger. But you can also imagine a bastardized form, where
the cryptographic checks are removed, the read/write access is centralized, and the
idea of a total digital history is used by a state to create an NSA/China-like system of
inescapable, lifelong surveillance.
This in turn leads us to a top-down view of history, the future trajectory we want to
avoid, where political power is used to defeat technological truth.",553
24,"2.3 Political Power and Technological Truth
In the top-down view, history is written by the winners. It is about political power
triumphing over technological truth.
Why does power care about the past? Because the morality of society is derived
from its history. When the Chinese talk about Western imperialism, they aren’t just
talking about some forgettable dust-up in the South China Sea, but how that relates to
generationsofcolonialismandoppression, totheEightNationsAllianceandtheOpium
Wars and so on. And when you see someone denounced on American Twitter as an
x-ist, history is likewise being brought to bear. Again, why are they bad? Because of
our history of x-ism...
As such, when you listen to a regime’s history, which you are doing every time you
hear its oﬃcial organs praise or denounce someone, you should listen critically.2.3. POLITICAL POWER AND TECHNOLOGICAL TRUTH 39",217
25,"2.3.1 Political Power as the Driving Force of History
How do the authorities use history? What techniques are they using? It’s not just a
random collection of names and dates. They have proven techniques for sifting through
the archives, for staﬃng a retinue of heros and villains from the past, for distilling the
documents into (politically) useful parables. Here are two of them.
•Political determinist model: history is written by the winners. People have heard
this saying, but taking it seriously has profound implications. For example, who-
ever claims to be writing the “ﬁrst draft of history” is therefore one of the win-
ners. For another, history is what’s useful to the regime. A classic example is
Katyn Forest: the admission that the Soviets did it would have delegitimized
their postwar control over Poland during the 1945-1991 period, but once the
USSR collapsed the truth could be revealed.
•Political mascot model: history is written by winners pretending to be acting
on behalf of losers. This is a variant of the political determinist model, also
known as “oﬀense archaeology,” and practiced by the modern American, Chinese,
and Russian establishments — all of whom portray themselves as victims. The
techniqueistopickamascotthatthestate claimstochampion, suchastheSoviet
Union’s proletariat, and then go through history to ﬁnd the worst examples of
the state’s current rival doing something bad to them.
Take these real events, put them on the front page, and ensure everyone knows
of them. Conversely, ensure oﬀ-narrative events are ignored or suppressed as
taboo. AgaintakingtheUSSRasacasestudy, thisinvolvedﬁndingendless(real!)
examples of Western capitalists screwing the working class, and suppressing the
worse (also real!) instances of Soviet communists gulaging theirworking class, as
well as cases of the working class itself behaving badly. Generalization to other
contexts is left as an exercise for the reader, but here’s a Russian example of what
an American would call “responsibility to protect” (R2P).
These techniques are used to write history that favors a state. Here are more examples:
•CCP China : Today’s Chinese media covers the Eight-Nations Alliance, the
Opium Wars, and the like exhaustively in its domestic output, as these events
show the malevolence of the European colonialists — who literally fought wars to
keep China subjugated and addicted to heroin. Their domestic history does not
mention the Uighurs, Tiananmen, and the like domestically. Xi’s CCP did stress
the domestic problem of corruption via the “Tigers and Flies” campaign...but
that’s in part because the anti-corruption campaign was politically useful against
his internal enemies, and seemed not to ensnare his allies.
•US Establishment : Today’s US establishment covers 6/4/1989 and the 2022
Russo-Ukrainian War heavily, because they are real events that make China and
Russia look bad and the US look good. It does not mention the 1900 Eight-
Nations Alliance (when the US helped invade China with a “coalition of the will-40 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
ing” to defend European imperialism) or the 1932 Ukrainian Holodomor (when
The New York Times Company’s Walter Duranty helped Soviet Russia choke out
Ukraine) as these cut in the opposite direction.
The current US narrative also does not stress the Cultural Revolution (which
bears too close a resemblance to present day America), or Western journalists
like Edgar Snow who helped Mao come to power, or the full ugly history of
American support for Russian and Chinese communism. This isn’t simply a
matter of the age of events — after all, regime media goes back further in time
when convenient, distorting events from 1619 for today’s headlines, yet somehow
their time machine stutters on the years 1932 or 1900. In modern America, as in
modern China, the history you hear about is the history the establishment ﬁnds
to be politically useful against its internal and external rivals.
•The British Empire : The British in both WW1 and WW2 understandably em-
phasized the evils of Germany, but not so much the evils of their ally Russia, or
their own evils during the Opium Wars, or the desire for the Indian subcontinent
to breathe free, and so on. (This one is almost too easy as the UK is no longer
a contender for heavyweight champion of the world, so no one is oﬀended when
someone points out its past self-serving inconsistencies. Indeed, documenting the
UK’s sins is now a cottage industry for Britain’s virtue signalers, as beating up
on a beaten empire is far easier than tackling the taboos of a still live one.)
Point being: once you get your head out of the civilization you grew up in, and look at
things comparatively, the techniques of political history become obvious. One of those
techniques deserves special mention, and that’s a peacetime version of the “atrocity
story”:
One of the most time-honored techniques to mobilize public animosity
against the enemy and to justify military action is the atrocity story. This
technique, says Professor Lasswell, has been used “with unvarying success
in every conﬂict known to man.”
The concept is as useful in peacetime as it is in war. Why? Because states get their
people hyped up to ﬁght wars by stressing the essentially defensive nature of what they
are doing and the savage behavior of the enemy. But war is politics by other means, so
politics is war by other means. Even in peacetime, the state is predicated on force. And
this use of force requires justiﬁcation. The atrocity story is the tool used to convince
people that the use of state force is legitimate.
Coming from a diﬀerent vantage point, Rene Girard would call this a “founding mur-
der.” Once you see this technique, you see it everywhere. Somewhat toned-down
versions of the atrocity story are the go-to technique used to justify expansions of
political power.
•If we don’t force people to take oﬀ their shoes at the airport, people will die!
•If we don’t stop people from voluntarily taking experimental curative drugs, peo-2.3. POLITICAL POWER AND TECHNOLOGICAL TRUTH 41
ple will die!
•If we don’t set up a disinformation oﬃce to stop people from making hostile
comments online, people will die!
Indeed, almost everything in politics is backed by an atrocity story.There’s a some-
times real, sometimes fake, sometimes exaggerated Girardian founding murder (or at
least founding injury) behind much of what the government does.
Sometimes the atrocity story is framed in terms of terrorists, sometimes in terms of
children...but the general concept is “something so bad happened, we must use (state)
force to prevent it from happening again.” Often this completely ignores the death
caused by that force itself. For example, when the FDA “prevented” deaths by cracking
down on drug approvals after thalidomide, it caused many more deaths via Eroom’s
Law and drug lag.
Andsometimestheatrocitystoryisjustcompletelyfake; beforeIraqwasfalselyaccused
of holding WMD, it was falsely accused of tossing babies from incubators.
With that said, it’s possible to overcorrect here. Just because there is an incentive to
fake (or exaggerate) atrocities does not mean that allatrocities are fake or exagger-
ated.Yes, you should be aware that states are always “ﬂopping,” exaggerating the
severity of the fouls against them or the mascots they claim to represent, trying to
bring in the public on their side, whether they are Chinese or American or Russian.
But once you’re aware of the political power model of history, the next goal is to guard
against both the Scylla and the Charybdis, against being too credulous andtoo cynical.
Because just as the atrocity story is a tool for political power, unfortunately so too is
genocide denial — as we can see from The New York Times’ Pulitzer-winning coverup
of Stalin’s Ukrainian famine.
To maintain this balance, to know when states are lying or not, we need a form of truth
powerful enough to stand outside any state and judge it from above. A way to respond
to oﬃcial statistics not with either reﬂexive faith or disbelief, but with dispassionate,
independent calculation.",1993
26,"The bottom-up cryptohistory we introduced in the previous section is clearly relevant.
But to fully appreciate it we need an allied theory: the technological truth theory of
history.42 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY",49
27,"2.3.2 Technological Truth as the Driving Force of History
The political power model of history gives us a useful lens: history isoften just Leninist
who/whom and Schmittian friend/enemy. But it’s a little parchedto say that history
is always and only that, solelyabout the raw exercise of political power. After all, a
society must pass down true facts about nature, for example, or else its crops will not
grow— and its political class will losepower.
This leads to a diﬀerent set of tech-focused lenses for analyzing history.
•Technological determinist model: technology is the driving force of history . While
the political determinist model stresses that history is written — and hence dis-
torted — by the winners, and thereby propagates only that which is useful to a
given state, the technological determinist model notes that there are some key
areas — principally in science and technology — where many (if not most) soci-
eties derive a beneﬁt from passing down a technical fact withoutdistortion. There
is after all an unbroken chain from Archimedes, Aryabhata, Al-Kwarizhmi, and
antiquity to all our existing science and technology. Hundreds of years later, we
don’t care that much about the laws of Isaac Newton’s time, but we do care about
Newton’s laws. In this model, all political ideologies have been around for all time
— the only thing that changes is whether a given ideology is now technologically
feasible as an organizing system for humanity. Thus: political fashions just come
and go in cycles, so the absolute measure of societal progress is a culture’s level
of technological advancement on something like the Kardashev scale.
•Trajectory model: histories are trajectories. We mentioned this concept before
when we discussed history as a cryptic epic of twisting trajectories, but it’s worth
reprising. If you’re technically inclined, you might wonder why we spend so
much time on history in this book. One answer is that histories are trajectories
of dynamical systems. If you can spend your entire life studying wave equations,
diﬀusion equations, time series, or the Navier-Stokes equations — and you can —
you can do the same for the dynamics of people. In more detail, we know from
physics (and Stephen Wolfram!) that very simple rules can produce incredibly
complicated trajectories of dynamical systems. For Navier-Stokes, for example,
we can divide these trajectories up into laminar ﬂow, turbulent ﬂow, inviscid2.3. POLITICAL POWER AND TECHNOLOGICAL TRUTH 43
ﬂow, incompressible ﬂow, and so on, to describe diﬀerent ways a velocity ﬁeld
can evolve over time. These classiﬁcations are derived from measurements made
of ﬂuids over time. And the study of just one of these trajectory types can be a
whole research discipline.
That’s how rich the dynamics of inanimate objects are. Now compare that to
the macroscopic movements of millions of intelligent agents. You can similarly
try to derive rules about how humans behave under situations of laminar good
times, turbulent revolutionary times, and so on by studying the records we have
of human behavior — the data exhaust that humans produce.
This analogy is actually very tight if you think about virtual economies and the
history of human behavior on social networks and cryptosystems. In the fullness
of time, with truly open datasets, we may even be able to develop Asimovian
psychohistory from all the data recorded in the ledger of record, namely a way to
predict the macroscopic behavior of humans in certain situations without know-
ing every microscopic detail. We can already somewhat do this for constructed
environments like gamesand markets, and ever more human environments are
becoming literally digitally constructed.
•Statistical model: history aids predictions . From a statistician’s perspective, his-
tory is necessary for accurately computing the future. See any time series analysis
or machine learning paper — or the Kalman ﬁlter, which makes this concept very
explicit. To paraphrase Orwell, without a quantitatively accurate record of the
past you cannot control the future, in the sense that your control theory literally
won’t work.
•Helix model: linear and cyclical history can coexist . From a progressive’s perspec-
tive, history is a linear trend, where the “arc of history” bends towards freedom,
and where those against a given cause are on the wrong side of history. Others
think of history as cyclical, a constant loop where the only thing these technolo-
gists are doing is reinventing the wheel, or where “strong men create good times,
good times create weak men, weak men create hard times, and hard times cre-
ate strong men.” But there’s a third view, a helical view of history, which says
that from one viewpoint history is indeed progressive, from another it’s genuinely
cyclical, and the reconciliation is that we move a bit forward technologically with
each turn of the corkscrew rather than collapsing. In this view, attempts to re-
store the immediate preceding state are unlikely, as they’re rewinding the clock
— but you might be able to get to a good state by winding the helix all the way44 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
past 12’o’clock to get the reboot. Or you might just collapse.
•Ozymandias model: civilization can collapse. History shows us that technological
progress is not inevitable. The Fall of Civilizations podcast really makes this
clear. Gobekli Tepe is one example. Whether you’re thinking of this as an
astronomer (where are all the intelligent life forms out there? Is the universe a
dark forest?) or an anthropologist (how did all these advanced civilizations just
completely die out?), it’s sobering to think that our civilization may just be like
the best player in a video game so far: we’ve made it the furthest, but we have
no guarantee that we’re going to win before killing ourselvesand wiping out
like all the other civilizations before us.
•Lenski model: organisms are not ordinal. Richard Lenski ran a famous series of
long-term evolution experiments with E. coli where he picked out a fresh culture
of bacteria each day, froze it down in suspended animation, and thereby saved
a snapshot of what each day of evolution looked like over the course of decades.
The amazing thing about bacteria is that they can be unfrozen and reanimated,
so Lenski could take an old E. coli strain from day 1173 and put it into a test
tube with today’s strain to see who’d reproduce the most in a head-to-head
competition. The result showed that history is not strictly ordinal ; just because
the day 1174 strain had outcompeted the day 1173 strain, and the day 1175 strain
had outcompeted the day 1174 strain, and so on — does notnecessarily mean
that today’s strain will always win a head to head with the strain from day 1173.
The complexity of biology is such that it’s more like an unpredictable game of
rock/paper/scissors.
•Train Crash model: those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it. Another
way to think about history is as a set of expensive experiments, where people
often made certain choices that seemed reasonable at the time and ended up in
calamitous straits. That’s communism, for example: a persuasive idea for many,
but one that history shows to not actually produce great results in practice.
•Idea Maze model: those who overﬁt to history will never invent the future. This
is the counterargument to the Train Crash model — past results may not predict
future performance, and sometimes you need to have a beginner’s mindset to
innovate. Generally this works better for opt-in technologies and investments
than top-down modiﬁcations of society like communism. One tool for this comes
fromaconceptIwroteupawhileagocalledtheideamaze. Therelevantbithereis
thatjustbecauseabusinesspropositiondidn’tworkinthepastdoesn’tnecessarily
mean it won’t work today. The technological and social prerequisites may have
dramatically changed, and doors previously closed may now have opened. Unlike
the laws of physics, society is not time invariant. As even the world’s leading
anti-tech blog once admitted:2.3. POLITICAL POWER AND TECHNOLOGICAL TRUTH 45
Virtual reality was an abject failure right up to the moment it wasn’t.",1984
28,"In this way, it has followed the course charted by a few other breakout
technologies. They don’t evolve in an iterative way, gradually gaining
usefulness. Instead, theyseemhardly toadvance atall, moving forward
in ﬁts and starts, through shame spirals and bankruptcies and hype
and defensive crouches — until one day, in a sudden about-face, they
utterly, totally win.
•Wright-Fisher model: history is what survives natural selection. In population
genetics, there’s an important model of how mutations arise and spread called
the Wright-Fisher model. When a new mutation arises, it’s in only 1 out of N
people. How does it get to N out of N, to 100%, to what’s called “ﬁxation”? Well,
ﬁrst, it might not ever do that. It might just die out. It might also get to N out of
N simply by luck, if the population of N is small — this is known as “ﬁxation by
genetic drift,” where those with the mutation just happen to reproduce more than
others. But if the mutation confers some selective advantage s, if it aids in the
reproduction of its host in a competitive environment, then it has a better than
luck chance of getting to 100%. Similarly, those historical ideas that we’ve heard
about can be thought of as those that aided or at least did not interfere with
the propagation of their respective carriers, often the authorities that write those
histories. Some of these ideas have tagged along by dumb luck, while others are
claims that were selectively advantageous to the success of the regime - often by
delegitimizing their rivals and legitimizing their own rule, or by giving them new
technologies. This is a theory of memetic evolution; the ideological mutations
that add technological edge or political power are the ones selected for.
•Computational model: history is the on-chain population; all the rest is editorial-
ization. There’s a great book by Franco Moretti called Graphs, Maps, and Trees .
It’s a computational study of literature. Moretti’s argument is that every other
study of literature is inherently biased. The selection of which books to discuss
is itself an implicit editorialization. He instead makes this completely explicit by
creating a dataset of full texts, and writing code to produce graphs. The argu-
ment here is that only a computational history can represent the full population
in a statistical sense; anything else is just a biased sample.
•Genomic model: history is what DNA (and languages, and artifacts) show us.
David Reich’s Who We Are and How We Got Here is the canonical popular
summary of this school of thought, along with Cavalli-Sforza’s older book on the
History and Geography of Human Genes . The brief argument is: our true history
is written in our genes. Mere texts can be faked, distorted, or lost, but genomics
(modern or ancient) can’t be. Languages and artifacts are a bit less robust in
terms of the signal for historical reconstruction, though they often map to what
the new genomic studies are showing about patterns of ancient migrations.
•Tech Tree model: history is great men constrained by the adjacent possible . As
context, the great man theory of history says that individuals like Isaac Newton46 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
and Winston Churchill shaped events. The counterargument says that these men
were carried on tides larger than them, and that others would have done the
same in their place. For example, for many (not all) Newtons, there is a Leibniz,
who could also have invented calculus. It’s impossible to fullytest either of these
theories without a Lenski-like experiment where we re-run history with the same
initial conditions, but a useful model to reconcile the two perspectives is the tech
tree from Civilization . Brieﬂy, all known science represents the frontier of the
tree, and an individual can chooseto extend that tree in a given direction. There
wasn’t really a Leibniz for Satoshi, for example; at a time when others were
focused on social, mobile, and local, he was working on a completely diﬀerent
paradigm. But he wasconstrained by the available subroutines, concepts like
Hashcash and chained timestamps and elliptic curves. Just like da Vinci could
have conceived a helicopter, but probably not built it with the materials then
available, the tech tree model allows for individual agency but subjects it to
the constraint of what is achievable by one person in a given era. The major
advantage of a tech tree is that (like the idea maze) it can be made visible, and
navigable, as has been done for longevity by the Foresight Institute.
You might ﬁnd it a bit surprising that there are as many diﬀerent models for under-
standing history — let’s call them historical heuristics — as there are programming
paradigms. Why might this be so? Well, just like the idea of statecraft strategies that
we introduce later, the study of history can also be analogized to a type of program-
ming, or at least data analysis. That is, history is the analysis of the log ﬁles.
•Data exhaust model: history as the analysis of the log ﬁles . Here, we mean
“log ﬁles” in the most general sense of everything society has written down or
left behind; the documents, yes, but also the physical artifacts and genes and
artwork, just like a log “ﬁle” can contain binary objects and not just plain text.
Extending the analogy, you can try to debug a program by ﬂying blind without
the logs, or alternatively you can try to look at every row of the logs, but rather
than either of these extremes you’ll do best if you have a method for distilling
the logs into something actionable.
And that’s why historical heuristics exist. They are strategies for distilling insight from
all the documents, genes, languages, transactions, inventions, collapses, and successes
of people over time. History is the entire record of everything humanity has done. It’s
a very rich data structure that we have only begun to even think of asa data structure.
We can now think of written history as an (incomplete, biased, noisy) distillation of
this full log. After all, if you’ve ever found a reporter’s summary of an eyewitness video
to be wanting, or found a single video misleading relative to multiple camera angles,
you’ll realize why having access to the fulllog of public events is a huge step forward.2.3. POLITICAL POWER AND TECHNOLOGICAL TRUTH 47",1536
29,"2.3.3 A Collision of Political Power and Technological Truth
We’ve now deﬁned a top-down and bottom-up model of history. The collision of these
two models, of the establishment’s Orwellian relativismand the absolute truth of the
Bitcoin blockchain, of political power and technological truth...that collision is worth
studying.
Let’s do three concrete examples where political power has encountered technological
truth.
•Tesla > NYT . Elon Musk used the instrumental record of a Tesla drive to knock
down an NYT story. The New York Times Company claimed the car had run
out of charge, but his dataset showed they had purposefully driven it around
to make this happen, lying about their driving history. His numbers overturned
their letters.
•Timestamp > Macron, NYT . Twitter posters used a photo’s timestamp to dis-
prove a purported photo of the Brazilian ﬁres that was tweeted by Emmanuel
Macron and printed uncritically by NYT. The photo was shown via reverse image
search to be taken by a photographer who had died in 2003, so it was more than
a decade old. This was a big deal because The Atlantic was literally calling for
war with Brazil over these (fake) photos.
•Provable patent priority . AChinesecourtusedanon-chaintimestamptoestablish
priority in a patent suit. One company proved that it could not have infringed
the patent of the other, because it had ﬁled “on chain” before the other company
had ﬁled.
In the ﬁrst and second examples, the employees of the New York Times Company
simply misrepresented the facts as they are wont to do, circulating assertions that were
politically useful against two of their perennial opponents: the tech founder and the
foreign conservative. Whether these misrepresentations were made intentionally or out
of “too good to check” carelessness, they were both attempts to exercise political power
that ran into the brick wall of technological truth. In the third example, the Chinese
political system delegated the job of ﬁnding out what was true to the blockchain.
In all three cases, technology provided a more robust means of determining what was
true than the previous gold standards — whether that be the “paper of record” or
the party-state. It decentralized the determination of truth away from the centralized
establishment.48 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY",534
30,"2.3.4 A Deﬁnition of Political and Technological Truths
It isn’t always possible to decentralize the determination of truth away from a political
establishment. Some truths are intrinsically relative (and hence political), whereas
others are amenable to absolute veriﬁcation (and hence technological).
Here’s the key: is it true if others believe it to be true, or is it true regardless of what
people believe?
A political truth is true if everyone believes it to be true. Things like money, status,
and borders are in this category. You can change these by rewriting facts in people’s
brains. For example, the question of what a dollar is worth, who the president is, and
where the border of a country is are all dependent on the ideas installed in people’s
heads. If enough people change their minds, markets move, presidents change, and
borders shift.
Conversely, a technical truth is true even if no human believes it to be true. Facts
in math, physics, and biochemistry are in this category. They exist independent of
what’s in people’s brains. For example, what’s the value of , the speed of light, or the
diameter of a virus?
Those are the two extremes: political truths that you can change by rewriting the
software in people’s brains, and technical truths that exist independent of that.",316
31,"2.3.5 A Balance of Political Power and Technological Truth
Once you reluctantly recognize that not everyaspect of a sociopolitical order can be
derived from an objective calculation, and that some things really dodepend on an
arbitrary consensus, you realize that we need to maintain a balance between political
power and technological truth.
Towards this end, the Chinese have a pithy saying: the backwards will be beaten.
If you’re bad at technology, you’ll be beaten politically. Conversely, the Americans
also have a saying: “you and what army?” It doesn’t matter how good you are as an
individualtechnologistifyou’rebadlyoutnumberedpolitically. Andifyou’reunpopular
enough, you won’t have the political power to build in the physical world.2.4. GOD, STATE, NETWORK 49
Combining these views tells us to seek a balance between nationalism and rationalism,
where the former is thought of in the broadest sense as “group identity.” It’s a balance
between political power and technological truth, between ingroup-stabilizing narratives
and inconvenient facts. And you need both.
So that’s how the political and technological theories of history interrelate. Technolog-
ical history is the history of what works; political history is the history of what works
to retain power. Putting all the pieces together:
•We have a political theory of history that says “social and political incentives
favor the propagation of politically useful narratives.”
•We have a technological theory of history that says “ﬁnancial and technical in-
centives favor the propagation of technological truths.”
•We have a set of examples that show how politically powerful actors were con-
strained by decentralizing technology.
•We have more examples that show that some facts really are determined by
societal consensus, while others are amenable to decentralized veriﬁcation.
•And we understand why groups need both to survive; the backwards will be
beaten, while the unpopular will never have political power in the ﬁrst place.
Can we generalize these observations into a broader thesis, into an overarching theory
that includes the clash of political power and technological truth as a special case? We
can. And that leads us to a discussion of God, State, and Network.",523
32,"2.4 God, State, Network
The collision between the top-down and bottom-up views of history, between history
as written by the winners and history as written to the ledger, between political power
and technological truth...that encounter is a collision of Leviathans.
To understand this, imagine two schoolboys ﬁghting on a playground. It’s not long
before one of them says “my dad can beat up your dad!” There’s profundity in this
banality. Even at a very young age, a child believes he can appeal to a higher power,
a Leviathan, a powerful man who can sweep the ﬁeld of his enemies, including Robert
from recess.
Men are not so diﬀerent from children in this regard. Every doctrine has its Leviathan,
that prime mover who hovers above all. For a religion, it is God. For a political
movement, it is the State. And for a cryptocurrency, it is the Network. These three
Leviathans hover over fallible men to make them behave in pro-social ways.
Once we generalize beyond God, once we realize there’s not one but threeLeviathans in
a Hobbesian sense, much becomes clear. Movements that aren’t God-worshipping reli-
gions are often State-worshipping political movements or Network-worshipping crypto50 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
tribes. Many progressive atheists are by no means astatists; they worship the State as
if it were God. And many libertarian atheists may not believe in either God orthe
State, but they do believe in the Network - whether that be their social network or
their cryptocurrency.
This deserves some elaboration.",392
33,"2.4.1 What is the Most Powerful Force in the World?
The ﬁrst Leviathan was God. In the 1800s, people didn’t steal because they actually
fearedGod. They believed in a way that’s hard for us to understand, they thought
of God as an active force in the world, ﬁring-and-brimstoning away. They wanted
god-fearing men in power, because a man who genuinely believed in God would behave
well even if no one could punish him. That is, a powerful leader who actually believed
that eternal damnation was the punishment for violating religious edicts could be relied
upon by the public even ifno human could seewhether he had misbehaved. At least,
this is a rational retroﬁtting of why being genuinely “god-fearing” was important to
people, though they might not articulate it in quite that way. God was the ultimate
force, the Leviathan.
By the late 1800s, Nietzsche wrote that “God is dead.” What he meant is that a critical
mass of the intelligentsia didn’t believe in God anymore, not in the same way their
forefathers did. In the absence of God, a new Leviathan now rose to pre-eminence, one
that existed before but gained new signiﬁcance: the State. And so in the 1900s, why
didn’tyousteal? Becauseevenifyoudidn’tbelieveinGod, theStatewouldpunishyou.
The full global displacement of God by the State (something already clearly underway
in France since 1789) led to the giant wars of the 20th century, Democratic Capitalism
vs Nazism vs Communism. These new faiths replaced g-o-d with g-o-v, faiths which
centered the State over God as the most powerful force on earth.
That brings us to the present. Now, today, as you can see from this graph and this
one, it is not just God that is dead. It is the State that is dying. Because here in the
early innings of the 21st century, faith in the State is plummeting. Faith in God has
crashed too, though there may be some inchoate revival of religious faith pending. But
it is the Network — the internet, the social network, and now the crypto network —
that is the next Leviathan.
So: in the 1800s you wouldn’t steal because God would smite you, in the 1900s you
didn’t steal because the State would punish you, but in the 2000s you can’t steal
because the Network won’t let you.Either the social network will mob you, or2.4. GOD, STATE, NETWORK 51
the cryptocurrency network won’t let you steal because you lack the private key, or
(eventually) the networked AI will detect you, or all of the above.
Put another way, what’s the most powerful force on earth? In the 1800s, God. In
the 1900s, the US military. And by the mid-2000s, encryption. Because as Assange
put it, no amount of violence can solve certain kinds of math problems. So it doesn’t
matter how many nuclear weapons you have; if property or information is secured by
cryptography, the state can’t seize it without getting the solution to an equation.",748
34,"2.4.2 Rubber Hoses Don’t Scale
Now, the obvious response is that a state like Venezuela can still try to beat someone
up to get that solution, do the proverbial rubber hose attack to get their password and
private keys — but ﬁrst they’ll have to ﬁnd that person’s oﬄine identity, map it to a
physical location, establish that they have jurisdiction, send in the (expensive) special
forces, and do this to an endless number of people in an endless number of locations,
while dealing with various complications like anonymous remailers, multisigs, zero-
knowledge, dead-man’sswitches, andtimelocks. Soataminimum, encryptionincreases
thecostof state coercion.
In other words, seizing Bitcoin is not quite as easy as inﬂating a ﬁat currency. It’s
not something a hostile state like Venezuela can seize en masse with a keypress, they
need to go house-by-house. The only real way around this scalability problem would
be a cheap autonomous army of AI police drones, something China may ultimately be
capable of, but that’d be expensive and we aren’t there yet.
Until then, the history of Satoshi Nakamoto’s successful maintenance of pseudonymity,
of Apple’s partial thwarting of the FBI, and of the Bitcoin network’s resilience to the
Chinese state’s mining shutdown show that the Network’s pseudonymity and cryptog-
raphy are already partially obstructing at least some of the State’s surveillance and
violence.
Encryption thus limits governments in a way no legislation can. And as described at
length in this piece, it’s not just about protection of private property. It’s about using
encryption and crypto to protect freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of
contract, prevention from discrimination andcancellation via pseudonymity, individual
privacy,andtrulyequalprotectionunderrule-of-code—evenastheState’spaper-based
guarantees of the same become ever more hollow. Because the computer always gives
the same output given the same input code, unlike the fallible human judiciary with
its error-prone (or politicized) enforcement of the law.52 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
In this sense, the Network is the next Leviathan, because on key dimensions it is
becoming more powerful and more justthan the State.",551
35,"2.4.3 The Network is the Next Leviathan
When we say that the Network is the next Leviathan, which we can abbreviate as
“Network > State” it is useful to give speciﬁcs. Here are several concrete examples
where the Network’s version of a given social practice is more powerful than the State’s
version.
1.Encryption > State Violence. When there is strong encryption government can’t
crack, that means communications states can’t eavesdrop on, transactions they
can’t intercept, and digital borders they can’t penetrate. It means nothing less
than the ability to organize groups outside state control, and thus a diminution
in the power of states tocontrol.
2.Cryptoeconomy > Fiat Economy. We just discussed this in the context of the
Network’s Bitcoin being money the State can’t easily freeze, seize, ban, or print.
In theory this is just a special case of the point on encryption, but its implications
are broad: all manner of ﬁnancial instruments, corporate vehicles, accounting,
payroll, and the like can be done on-chain outside the control of states.
3.Peer-to-Peer > State Media. There are two kinds of state media: state-controlled
media as in China’s Xinhuanet, or state- controlmedia as in America’s The New
York Times. The latter controls the state, the former is controlled by the state,
but both ﬁght freedom of speech. Network-facilitated P2P communication is
anathema to them, particularly if end-to-end encrypted. Citations in particular
are worth calling out here — archival references like Google Books, or NCBI, or
archive.is can be linked to prove a point, even if oﬃcial State channels aren’t
presently favoring that point of view.
4.Social > National. Social networks change many things, but a critical one is that
they change the nature of community. Your community is your social network,
not necessarily the people who live near you. When the network identity is more
salient than the neighor relationship, it challenges the very premise of the West-
phalian state, which is that (a) people who live geographically near each other
share values and (b) therefore laws should be based on geographic boundaries.
The alternative is that only people who are geodesically near each other in the
social network share values, and therefore the laws that govern them should be
based on network boundaries.
5.Mobile > Sessile. Mobile is making us more mobile. And law is a function of
latitude and longitude; as you change your location, you change the local, state,
and federal laws that apply to you. As such, migration is as powerful a way to
change the law under which you live as election. COVID-19 lockdowns may be
just the beginning of State attempts to control Network-facilitated physical exit.2.4. GOD, STATE, NETWORK 53
But in normal circumstances, smartphones are helping people move ever more
freely, while the borders of physical states are frozen in place.
6.Virtual Reality > Physical Proximity. As a complement to mobile, the Network
oﬀers another way to opt out of State-controlled physical surroundings: namely,
to put on a VR (or AR) headset, at which point you are in a completely diﬀerent
world with diﬀerent people surrounding you and diﬀerent laws.
7.Remote > In-person. The Network allows you to work and communicate from
anywhere. Combined with mobile, this further increases leverage against the
State. The concept of the network state as a division of the world by people
rather than by land is particularly important here, as network states are natively
built for getting voluntary subscription revenue from people around the world.
The diaspora isthe state.
8.International > National. The Network gives people more of a choiceover what
speciﬁc State they are subject to. For example, they can move a server hosting
their website from country to country with a few clicks.
9.Smart Contracts > Law. The State’s paper-based legal system is costly and
unpredictable. A similar set of facts in two diﬀerent cities in the same country
could result in a diﬀerent ruling. Lawyers are expensive, paper contracts have
typos and illogic, and cross-border agreements range from complex to impossible.
We’re still in the early days of smart contracts, but as we get well-debugged
and formally-veriﬁed contract libraries, this is an area where the Network is
poised to take over from the State. Imagine truly international law: it’s done
programmatically rather than via pieces of paper, across borders outside the
domain of legacy states, and by global technologists rather than country-speciﬁc
lawyers.
10.Cryptographic Veriﬁcation > Oﬃcial Conﬁrmation. Perhaps the most important
arena in which the Network is stronger than the state is in the nature of truth
itself. As incredible as it may sound, the blockchain is the most important de-
velopment in history since the advent of writing itself, as it’s a cryptographically
veriﬁable, highly replicated, unfalsiﬁable, and provably complete digital record
of a system. It’s the ultimate triumph of the technological truth view of history,
as there are now technical andﬁnancial incentives for passing down true facts,
regardless of the sociopolitical advantages any given government might have for
suppressing them. To foreshadow a bit, this ledger of record is history written by
the Network rather than the State.
These examples can be multiplied. As mentioned before, Uber and Lyft are better
regulators than the State’s paper-based taxi medallions, email is superior to the USPS,
and SpaceX is out-executing NASA. If you think about borders, you now need to think
about the Network’s telepresence (which defeats physical borders) and its encryption
(which erects digital borders). Or if you care about, say, the US census, the Network
gives a real-time survey which is far more up to date than the State’s 10 year process.54 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
In short, if you can bring the Network to bear on an issue, it will often be the most
powerful force. This is essentially what every startup founder does, all the time: they
try to ﬁgure out the Network way of doing something, without going through the State.
There’s an app for that!
This is conceptually important, because a startup society founder that can reposition
a particular conﬂict such that it is the Network against the State has a chance to win.
But if they go through the legacy State, they’ll be an alligator out of water, and they
will likely lose.
Network > State: Trump’s Deplatforming
Applying the “Network > State” formulation to recent events, think about January
2021, when — at the behest of the New York Times Company and all of mainstream
media — Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter combined to deplatform a
sitting president and disappear his supporters’ app from the internet.
This was undeniable proof of the US government’s impotence, because the “most pow-
erful man in the world” was clearly no longer even the most powerful man in his own
country. The informal Network (the US establishment) trumped the formal State (the
US government).
Obviously, Trump and the Republicans weren’t in control of events. Less obviously,
elected Democrats weren’t either. Oh, sure, many of them added their voices to the
cacophony. But because the First Amendment constrains government capacity to re-
strain speech, they couldn’t tell the tech CEOs to shut down opposition voices - but
the publishers could. And because the ﬁnal control over these networks is in private
hands, state oﬃcials didn’t have the ﬁnal say.
Put another way, the people with their ﬁngers on the button are no longer elected
oﬃcials of the state. Does the US government feellike it is in charge? That is what
Network > State means.",1899
36,"2.4.4 The State is Still A Leviathan
To be clear, the Network does not win everyconﬂict with the State. In many cases the
actualoutcomeis“State>Network.” Indeed, theconﬂictbetweenthesetwoLeviathans2.4. GOD, STATE, NETWORK 55
will shape this century like the conﬂict between the God and State Leviathans shaped
the last.
Some examples of “State > Network” include Ross Ulbricht’s arrest by the US govern-
ment, the persecution of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, China’s crackdown on
cryptocurrency, the European Union’s GDPR regulation, the COVID lockdowns that
inhibited any digital nomad’s ability to exit, the rising number of government internet
shutdowns, and the US establishment’s push to censor the internet.
Let’s review a few cases of particular importance: the techxit from San Francisco, the
political defeat of tech founders in China, the biasing of AI in the name of AI bias, and
the digital deplatforming of establishment critics in both the West and East.
1.SF city government > Bay Area tech founders. Despite how competent the tech
founders of SF were on the Network, the political billionaires of the San Francisco
city government managed to use their control of the State to turn the city into a
hellhole. Intentionally or not, this had the eﬀect of driving out the new money,
their potential competition.
Yes, there have been some successful tech-funded recall eﬀorts recently, but it’s
likely too little, too late. It’s akin to a stock price showing a bit of an upward
trend after a huge and irreversible drop. Because the Bay Area’s monopoly is
over. Technology has now globally decentralized into web3, and San Francisco
(and even Silicon Valley) has now lost its position as the undisputed tech capital
of the world. You no longer needto go to the Bay Area to build a startup — you
can found and fund from anywhere.
This is, on balance, a good thing — the fact that tech is no longer highly depen-
dent on the triple dysfunction of SF/CA/USA is crucial to the world’s future.
Note also that while the defeat of tech in SF was due to State > Network, the
reason tech lives to ﬁght another day is thanks to remote work, which allowed
movement away from SF in a “Techxit.” And remote work is a case of Network
> State.
2.CCP > Chinese tech founders. Until about 2018, Chinese tech founders were cel-
ebrated by the CCP. Imagine if Zuckerberg and Dorsey were given the equivalent
of Senate seats for their contribution to the economy, brought into the estab-
lishment rather than standing at a remove, and you’ll get a sense of what the
tone was like. Jack Ma (Alibaba founder), Pony Ma (Tencent founder), and their
peers were either one of the 95 million CCP members (<7% of the country) or
praised by CCP media.
Then everything shifted. Just like America, China had its own establishment-
driven techlash.The huge cost of pausing of the massive ANT Financial IPO56 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
on some regulatory pretense was a signal. For the last several years, the CCP has
put what it considers to be the “national interest” over enormous sums of money,
incurring at least a trillion dollars in cost for COVID lockdowns, shutdowns of
IPOs, and overnight bans of entire industries like gaming and Bitcoin mining.
This looks stupid. Maybe it is stupid. Or maybe they know something we don’t.
TheCCP’searlyactioninthe2000sand2010stobanforeignsocialnetworkslooks
farsightedinretrospect, asiftheyhadn’tbuilttheirownWeiboandWeChat, then
US executives in Silicon Valley would have been able to deplatform (or surveil)
anyone from China with a keystroke. So, unfortunately, perhaps signaling that
there are “more important things than money” and gearing for conﬂict will turn
out to put the CCP in a better position for what comes.
Be that as it may, the Chinese techlash is an example of “State > Network.” The
CCP-controlled Chinese State beat the international Network of Chinese tech
founders. But it didn’t win forever, as many of the most ambitious founders
and funders in China are now using the Network to move abroad and escape the
Chinese State.
3.Biasing AI with AI Bias. Jon Stokes has written at length about “AI ethics”
and I’d encourage you to read his work. But in brief, this entire pseudoﬁeld is
about putting a thumb on the scale of AI algorithms in the name of balancing
the scales, particularly at inﬂuential tech giants like Google. It’s about ensuring
that members of the US establishment are always looking over the shoulder of
technologists, making sure that their code is 100% regime compliant, just as
the Soviet Union did with its commissars, the NSDAP did with gleichschaltung ,
and Xi has done with Xuexi Qiangguo .
The fundamental concept is about asserting moral control over a technological
ﬁeld. AI “ethics” doesn’t really contest what is true or false, it contests what is
good and bad. And what is bad? Anything that advances a politically unfavor-
able narrative. As a concrete example, in 2021, Ukraine was widely reported to
be a corrupt country full of Azov Battalion Nazis. By mid 2022, those reports
would have been reclassiﬁed as “disinformation” and pushed down to page 10 of
the search results, if the AI bias people had their way.
Now, the usual dodge is that there’s always discretion involved in the selection
of any machine learning training set, and judgment used in the conﬁguration of2.4. GOD, STATE, NETWORK 57
any algorithm, so who is to say what “unbiased” means? But the goal here is
to make sure that discretion does not scatter randomly, or at the discretion of
the individual investigator, but instead consistently points in a single “ethically
approved” direction, whether that be submission to NYT (in Blue America) or
CCP (in China). It’s centralized political control by another name.
Note also that the name of their ﬁeld has been chosen to ward oﬀ attack. What,
are you against ethicsin AI? (These are the same people who speak mockingly
of “ethics in journalism” when it suits them.)
So, a better term for it is “AI bias,” not as in the studyof bias, but as in the
study of how to bias AI. And the power the AI bias people have is enormous.
A few zealots in the right places at big tech companies can and will distort
the Google results of billions of people, until and unless Google’s monopoly is
disrupted, or unless the right people within Google push to make their algorithms
transparent.Newspeak isn’t a dystopia for them, it’s an instruction manual.
And they might well win. The episode where Merriam-Webster changed the
dictionaryinreal-timeforpoliticalpurposesisonlythebeginning; thenewGoogle
is about to use its power to centrally change thought.
This is considerably worse than Baidu, which more straightforwardly ﬁlters
searches that are “problematic” for the CCP. Because the AI bias people pre-
tend that they are doing it for the powerless, when they are really doing it to
maintain the US establishment’s power.
4.Digital Deplatforming. Another example of the State trumping the Network, of
political power exercised against technological truth, can be seen in the muzzling
of regime-disfavored voices on social media.
As always, this is obvious in China. Say something the CCP doesn’t like on
Sina Weibo and your post disappears, and possibly your account and maybe
you’re brought in for “tea” by the security forces. But in the West, if you say
something the regime doesn’t like on Twitter, your post disappears, and possibly
your account, and — in American protectorates like the UK — maybe you’re
brought in for “tea” by the security forces.
Ah, didn’t expect that, did you? But click those links. The only reason that
UK-style hate speech laws haven’tyet come to the US is the First Amendment,
which has also limited to some degree the totality of private attempts at speech",2000
37,"and thought control.
Nevertheless, even by 2019 we could see the convergence of the American and
Chinese systems in this respect. Just as WeChat blocked mention of Tiananmen,
Facebook blocked mention of an alleged whistleblower. Operationally, it’s the58 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
same thing. In the East it’s oﬃcial government censorship, whereas in the West
it’s unoﬃcial private censorship, but that’s not a substantive diﬀerence - it’s
censorship as ordered by the Chinese and US establishments respectively. The
substantive diﬀerence is that in the West there’s a third faction of decentralized
censorship resistance.
The point is that sometimes Network > State (which is new), and sometimes State
> Network (which is what most people expect), and the competition between these
Leviathans will deﬁne our time.
But is it always competition, or could it also be co-optation?",226
38,"2.4.5 Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis
As Larry Ellison put it, “choose your competitors carefully, because you’ll become a lot
like them.” This is a tech founder’s version of the Hegelian dialectic, where thesis and
antithesis mix to form a synthesis.
In other words, when you have three Leviathans (God, State, Network) that keep
struggling with each other, they won’t remain pure forms. You’ll see people remix
them together to create new kinds of social orders, new hybrids, new syntheses in
the Hegelian sense. We already mentioned the Chinese version of this fusion (“the
backwards will be beaten”) in the context of political power vs technological truth, but
it goes beyond just the determination of truth to how society itself is organized. For
example:
•God/State : the mid-century US was “for god and country.” It stood against the
USSR, where people worshipped the State as God. (Though the US also had a
peer-to-peer Network component in the form of permitting capitalism within its
borders, and the USSR did too in the form of the “Communist International,”
the global network of spies fomenting communist revolution.)
•God/Network : this might be something like the Mormons, or the Jewish diaspora
beforeIsrael, oranyreligiousdiasporaconnectedbysomekindofcommunications
network. It’s a community of shared values connected by a communications
network without a formal state.
•God/State/Network : this is something like the Jewish diaspora afterIsrael. Our
One Commandment modelalsodrawsonthis, asastartupsocietycanbebasedon
a traditional religion or on a moral imperative that’s on par with many religious
practices, like veganism.
These are political examples of mixing Leviathans, but there are other ways of thinking
about the concept.2.4. GOD, STATE, NETWORK 59",450
39,"2.4.6 Synthesis: The Network/God
One important synthesis that deserves special mention is the “Network/God”: a Net-
work God, an AI God, a GPT-9 or DALL ·E 10 that gives instant, superhuman answers
to diﬃcult questions using the knowledge of all of humanity.
After all, people already do conﬁde to Google as if it were God, or at least a confessions
booth. In the 1980s there was a popular children’s book called Are You There God?
It’s Me, Margaret , and you can imagine an app version of this where people ask a given
AI God for advice.
That god need not be a general AI. It could encode a speciﬁc morality. It could be
tuned and trained on particular corpora rather than the general web. What would
Jesus do (WWJD), in an app? The Chinese Xuexi Qiangguo app could in fact be seen
as an early version of this — “What would Xi Jinping do?” — though one could also
have decentralized versions.
What would Lee Kuan Yew do? What would David Ben-Gurion do? What would
George Washington do? What would the people you respect advise in your situation?
A language model trained on their corpora — on all the public text and audio they’ve
emitted over their lives, which could amount to many millions of words — may achieve
something like the sci-ﬁ episode where people are revived by AI in an app. There’s
already a v1, it just needs to be augmented with a VR simulacrum. And even though
this kind of thing is painted as negative in media like HerandBlack Mirror , it’s really
not obvious that getting interactive advice from Lee Kuan Yew’s app is worse than
getting it from Lee Kuan Yew’s books.",424
40,"2.4.7 Synthesis: The Network/State
The study of God/State/Network syntheses brings us to the fusion we’re most inter-
ested in: a Network/State, of which one of them is our titular network state. And
there are a few diﬀerent ways to get to a Network/State fusion.
The ﬁrst is the from-scratch version described in chapter one, where an internet leader
builds a large enough network union online that it can crowdfund territory and eventu-
ally attain diplomatic recognition. But it’s worth discussing other scenarios, where ex-
isting governments fuse with the network — both positive and negative Network/State
syntheses.
Positive Syntheses: BTC, Web3, Eﬃciency
Start with the observation that companies, cities, currencies, communities, and coun-
tries are all becoming networks.
As an analogy, we used to think of books, music, and movies as distinct. Then they
all became represented by packets sent over the internet. Yes, we listened to music60 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
in audio players and viewed books in ebook readers, but their fundamental structure
became digital.
Similarly, today we think of stocks, bonds, gold, loans, and art as diﬀerent. But all
of them are represented as debits and credits on blockchains. Again, the fundamental
structure became digital.
Now, we are starting to think of diﬀerent kinds of collections of people –— whether
communities, cities, companies, or countries —– all fundamentally as networks, where
the digital proﬁles and how they interact become more and more fundamental.
This is obvious for communities and companies, which can already be fully remote and
digital, but even already existing cities and countries are starting to be modeled this
way, because (a) their citizensare often geographically remote, (b) the concept of
citizenship itself is becoming similar to digital single sign-on, (c) many 20th century
functions of government have already been de-facto transferred to private networks like
(electronic) mail delivery, hotel, and taxi regulation, (d) cities and countries increas-
ingly recruit citizens online, (e) so-called smart cities are increasingly administrated
through a computer interface, and (f) as countries issue central bank digital currencies
and cities likely follow suit, every polity will be publicly traded on the internet just like
companies and coins.
And that’s just for pre-existing polities which retroﬁt themselves with aspects of the
network. It doesn’t include the most fundamental network property of the de novo
network states described herein: namely that the citizenry itselfﬁrst assembles in the
cloud and only then crowdfunds the earth.
Examples of pre-existing states integrating with the network include (a) El Salvador’s
integration with the Bitcoin network, (b) Wyoming’s decentralized autonomous or-
ganization (DAO) law and Norway’s cap table bill, which are integrations with the
Ethereum network, and (c) places like Estonia and Singapore, where every government
workﬂow is already online. In each of these cases, cities and states are fusing with
networks to ship new services that are useful to citizens.
This is the benign version of the Network/State fusion, the one people will ﬂock to.
Negative Syntheses: USG, CCP, Monopoly
The malign version of the Network/State fusion is what happened in China, and is
happening in America at the federal level with the tech crackdowns. In both the
Chinese and American cases the State is “acquiring” centralized technology companies
at gunpoint, fusing with the Network from above.
In China the recipe was (a) a few years of media demonization plus (b) mandatory Xi
Jinping Thought sessions followed by (c) decapitation and quasi-nationalization –— as
is happening with Alibaba and ByteDance. In America during the techlash it was very2.4. GOD, STATE, NETWORK 61
similar: (a) several years of media demonization plus (b) quasi-mandatory wokeness
within followed by (c) anti-trust, regulation, and quasi-nationalization.
Sometimes the decapitation is forceful (Uber was an early target here) and sometimes
it’s quasi-voluntary. Indeed, one thesis on why many of the major tech founders have
stepped down as of mid-2022, other than Zuck, is that they don’t want to become
personally demonized during the no-win antitrust process. It’s more explicit in China
that this wasn’t a choice — Jack Ma is no longer in control of the company he founded,
and many other Chinese founders have been similarly relieved of their duties.
Inotherwords, boththeChineseandAmericanestablishmentshaveinventedrationales
to essentially seize previously founder-controlled companies.
That is, whatever the surface justiﬁcation, these are hostile takeovers of centralized
tech companies by centralized states. Once taken over, these companies will be turned
into total surveillance machines and tools of social control. In China, this is already
obvious. But in America, anti-trust may mean zero trust.
To be clear, this is partially a forecast for the future, and perhaps it can be averted, but
in the aftermath of any ostensibly “economic” settlement the US national security state
could get everything it ever wanted in terms of backdoors to Google and Facebook.
The NSA won’t need to hack its way in, it’ll get a front door. And then it will likely
get hacked in turn, spraying all of your data over the internet.

41,"2.4.8 Synthesis: God, State,
Can we put all three Leviathans together in the modern era? Is there something that’d
ﬁt?
Yes. The benign version of the network/state synthesis we’ve just described oﬀers
greater administrative eﬃciency, greater economic returns, and greater levels of citizen
consent. But it doesn’t yet oﬀer greater purpose, or meaning.
As a preview, that’s where the One Commandment comes in. The concept is that
you don’t want or need to start an entirely new religion to build a startup society,
but youdoneed a moral innovation of some kind. If all you have to oﬀer is a higher
standard of living, people may come as consumers, but they won’t come for the right
reasons. The consumer-citizen is coming to enjoy a great society, not to sacriﬁce to
make a society great. They won’t understand the valuesthat underpin your startup
society’s valuation. And you likely won’t be able to buildthat high valuation or higher
standard of living without a higher purpose, just as neither Apple nor America itself62 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
was initially built for money alone. You want to recruit producers, not consumers, and
for that, you’ll need a purpose.
Thathigherpurposecouldbeatraditionalreligion, asinRodDreher’s Benedict Option ,
but it could also be a doctrine with a deeply thought through “One Commandment,” a
moral innovation that inverts one of society’s core assumptions while keeping all others
intact.
For example, taking the seemingly trivial moral premise that “sugar is bad” and se-
riously carrying it through to build a Keto Kosher society involves a focused yet all-
encompassing change to every restaurant, grocery store, and meal within a jurisdiction.
We give more examples later.",456
42,"2.4.9 New Leviathan, New States
The concept of three Leviathans explains why a network state is now feasible. The
Network is a new sheriﬀ in town, a new Leviathan, a new force that is more powerful
than the State in many contexts. That has changed the balance of power. While
syntheses arearising, so are conﬂicts between Network and State. And that explains
much of today’s instability: when Leviathans wrestle, when Godzilla ﬁghts King Kong,
the earth trembles.",123
43,"2.5 People of God, People of the State, People of the

We’ve talked about the history of power, of God, State, and Network. Now let’s talk
about the recent history of power struggles, between people of God, people of the State,
and people of the Network.
Stereotypically, the people of God oﬀerthoughts and prayers, the people of the State
say “there oughta be a law!”, and the people of the Network write some code.
The diﬀerences go very deep. It’s a diﬀerence in ﬁrst steps and in ultimate loyal-
ties. Once you understand whether someone prioritizes the God, State, or Network
Leviathan you understand what tactics they’ll prefer, what values they hold, and where
they’re coming from.
To illustrate this, let’s apply the lens of Leviathans to analyze (a) the internal divisions

44,"2.5.1 American Tribes and Their Leviathans
The whole world tunes in daily to watch the endless American digital civil war on
Twitter. (“I feel bad for our country. But this is tremendous content.”) Countless
words have been written about this topic. But the lens of the Leviathans oﬀers a new
perspective on these warring tribes, on the conservative reds, progressive blues, and
libertarianish grays named by Scott Alexander.
The gray tribe is the easiest to analyze. It is fair to say that they are primarily
peopleoftheNetworkLeviathan. Thesetechnologicalprogressivesarenotjustatheists,
they are also astatists, as they do not typically believe in either God or the State.
They are genuinely internationalists in a way neither red nationalists nor blue faux
internationalists are, as they don’t subscribe to American exceptionalism, and interact
with people from other countries through the Network as equals.
The blues and the reds are more complex, however. It’s notas simple as “Blue equals
State” and “Red equals non-State.” Not at all. A signiﬁcant fraction of blues has now
gone to the Network; these are the left-libertarians, the web3 socialists. And a good
chunk of reds will remain loyal to the State; let’s call them secular nationalists.
So if and when things line up as Network vs State, if there’s a highly inﬂationary event
that pits the orange Bitcoin against the green Dollar, we may see an acceleration of
the ongoing realignment. Many blues will line up with grays and reds on the side of
the international Network, and many reds will side with blues to defend the centralized
American State.
Let’s explain.
Blue Tribe: Left-Authoritarians, Left-Libertarians
Each member of blue tribe will have to make a choice in the years to come: are they
loyal to neutral decentralized networks that treat both Americans and non-Americans
equally,oraretheyactuallyjustloyaltotheUSestablishment—essentiallynationalists
in disguise? Is their deﬁnition of “democracy” commensurate with a world where the
4% (namely the Americans) rule the 96% (namely the non-Americans), inﬂating away
the globe’s savings, destroying local cultures, and surveilling the world at all times? Or
do they believe the rest of the world deserves digital self-determination? In short, will64 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
the internationally-minded liberal choose the decentralized Network or the centralized
State?
To understand this choice, let’s orient ourselves. The blue tribe is the most powerful
in Western society today, and has twomain internal factions: the left-authoritarians
who worship the State, and the left-libertarians who are (unconsciously) people of the
Network.
Wokeness is a Doctrine, not a Religion
Before we begin, we need to understand that the blue belief system of “Wokeness” isn’t
exactly a religion. It’s a doctrine, and it includes both people of the State and the
Network.
That is, while it’s become popular to talk about Wokeness as a religion, and while
thereissomething to this, it’s more precise to talk about it as a doctrine: namely, “a
belief or set of beliefs held and taught by a church, political party, or other group.”
The concept of a doctrine encompasses religious andpolitical beliefs, both God- and
State-worship. And nowadays the “other group” could be a Network entity of some
kind, like a social network or cryptocurrency.
So now we have an umbrella term: doctrine. God-worshippers have religions (reli-
gious doctrines), State-loyalists have political parties (with political doctrines), and
Network-centrists have social networks or cryptocurrencies (with tightly enforced con-
tent moderation or crypto tribalism respectively, which are network doctrines). Each
doctrine has a Leviathan, a most powerful force. And a religion is then just a type of
doctrine.
With this deﬁnition, we can return to the question: is capital-W Wokeness, like Com-
munism and Nazism before it, a religion that evolved to jump over the formal principle
of church/state separation by posing as a non-religion? Well, as several have now ob-
served, Wokeness doeshave cognates to many aspects of Christianity — we all have
the Calvinist original sin of bigotry, we’re going to the warm hell of climate change
unless we repent, unbelievers must “recant,” heresy must be suppressed, the West’s
beliefs must be evangelized at gunpoint, and so on. See Curtis Yarvin’s How Dawkins
Got Pwned , John McWhorter’s Woke Racism , Andrew Sullivan on America’s New Re-
ligions, Noah Smith on Wokeness as Old-Time Religion , Tom Holland’s concluding
chapter in Dominion , Paul Graham on Heresy, and Michael Shellenberger and Peter
Boghossian’s detailed infographic for perspectives on this topic.
Butwhileit’sdirectionallyaccurate, callingwokenessareligiondoesn’t quiteﬁtbecause
the wokes have a diﬀerent theory of the prime mover. Wokeness is better termed a
doctrine, because it’s actually crucial to note that wokes do notworship God; instead,
one faction of wokes worships the State and the other is, less consciously, people of2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 65
the Network. These internal denominational splits are deﬁned by choice of Leviathan.
Andthey’llbeimportantintheescalatingconﬂictbetweenStateandNetwork, between
DollarandBitcoin,betweenestablishmentjournalistsanddecentralizedmedia,between
the American government and the global internet, as these divisions promise to split
blue team in two.
Blue State: Left-Authoritarians
Fortheleft-authoritariansamongtheblues, theirprimaryLeviathanistheState, which
isveryrealandcandoviolenceagainstits/theirenemies, asopposedtowhattheythink
of as an imaginary God. This is why State-worshippers mock the concept of “thoughts
and prayers” in favor of “passing a law.” The State exists, after all, and can organize
people to apply coercive force. But God’s vehicle, the church, no longer has enough
belief behind it (in the West at least) to do the same.
This is also why left-authoritarians tend to take for granted that all ills can be solved
by “praying for relief” to the State, by forming some agency, by appropriating ever
more money. Taxes are secular tithes, and the Gov-fearing man is like the God-fearing
man — you simply cannot pay enough money and respect to the state, because as the
DNC video says outright, “government is the one thing we all belong to.” It’s not about
results, it’s about fealty.
Even though they culturally love the State and hate the Network, it’s important to
note that the left-authoritarians in the US havemanaged to recently take control of
big chunks of the Network, through placing sympathizers in key positions at Big Tech
companies during the techlash and Great Awokening of the 2010s. (There are incipient
signs of pushback here, though, at places like Netﬂix and even Google, where the very
wokest are being terminated.)
What do left-authoritarians generally look like from an occupational standpoint? The
body of left-authoritarians are the NPCs paying the NYT monthly subscriptions for the
oﬃcial “truth,” slavishly turning their heads with every new software update, insisting
that masks don’t work before they do, reliably surging behind the current thing. These
are just foot soldiers, but interestingly the most important left-authoritarians aren’t
the elected oﬃcials.
AsYarvininparticularhasdocumentedatlength,themostimportantleft-authoritarians
are not formally part of the elected State at all. They are the professors, activists, bu-
reaucrats, and journalists.
The key concept is that much of America’s control circuitry has evolved to live outside
the formal state, thereby making it resistant to displacement by democratic election.
They laud “democracy” but avoid it in practice, through dual class stock, tenure for",1988
45,"their bureaucrats and professors, tax-exempt compounding for their foundations, and
ideological puriﬁcation of their organizations. As with the communists who endlessly
burbled about their “democratic people’s republics” while eschewing elections, the left-66 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
authoritarians don’t actually subject their control of key institutions to a vote.
There are diﬀerent names for this left-authoritarian network that controls the state
from outside by “holding it accountable.” We can call it the Paper Belt (which em-
phasizes their Rust-Belt-like technological backwardness), we can call it the Cathedral
(which emphasizes their holiness), we can call it the regime (which emphasizes their
illegitimacy), or we can call it simply the American establishment (which emphasizes
their enduring power). Later we will call it NYT/USD, to emphasize their source of
truth and digital economy relative to BTC/web3 and CCP/RMB.
It’s important to understand that the power of the left-authoritarians comes from
gettingtheoﬃcialsofthecentralizedAmericanStateand(morerecently)theexecutives
of the centralized Big Tech Network to crush their enemies.
Themaintechniqueisto“manipulateproceduraloutcomes”, oftenbygettingsomething
true to be oﬃcially deemed disinformation (as in the example of the pre-2020 election
laptop story), or conversely getting something false to be deemed oﬃcial truth (as
in the case of the Cambridge Analytica story). The left-authoritarians are the main
proponents of the political power theory of truth, as “truth” is whatever they ﬁnd
helpful to move political power into action.
When an employee of a media corporation talks about an article having “impact,” for
example, they mean impact in the sense of a government truncheon impacting your
head, via a new rule or regulation. Go read the descriptions of the prizes they award
to each other, and you’ll see them celebrate themselves for making something that was
previously volitional newly mandatory or forbidden. “Our report led to government
action!” Whether that action was the bombing of Libya or the banning of plastic
straws makes no nevermind; impact is impact.
Laws aren’t the only form of impact. Getting someone ﬁred is too. We talk of hit
pieces and cancel culture as if they’re aberrations, but they’re actually the core of
left-authoritarian culture. Recall that the most prestigious thing any establishment
journalist ever did was Watergate: namely, getting a president ﬁred while selling mil-
lions of copies of their newspaper.
This episode has been endlessly romanticized, but here’s a diﬀerent perspective on
it: the corporate takeover of America we’re supposed to be constantly vigilant for
actually already occured 50 years ago, just from the left, when a few privately-owned
media corporations cooperated to get Nixon ﬁred and the Pentagon Papers leaked,
proving that the control circuitry outsidethe State was upstream of the mere elected
government and US military.
Now, was Watergate a crime? Sure, but worse than the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution?
Worse than the Nasiriyah testimony? Worse than WMD? Worse than the lies used to2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 67
drive America’s many wars? And, relevantly, worse than what JFK did to get elected?
After all, contra his protestations, Nixon may well have been a crook, but as Seymour
Hersh has convincingly reported, so was John F. Kennedy — yet the exposure of his
Watergate-level election shenanigans somehow waited till thirty years after he ascended
to the presidency over one Richard Milhous Nixon.
Anyway, the problem isn’t just the asymmetry of the “accountability” — that’s not
really about hypocrisy, but hierarchy. The problem with America’s left-authoritarians
is also that they’ve built a terrible culture. A society that puts Watergate on a pedestal
is just fundamentally diﬀerent from one that puts NASA (or SpaceX) on a pedestal.
Because if what’s applauded is putting a man out of work, rather than putting a man
onthemoon, therewillbealotofcancellationandnotalotofcreation. Firingsomeone
should be a necessary evil, not the highest good.
We linger on Watergate because it was the moment when the left-authoritarian Amer-
ican Network outside the State became unambiguously ascendant. It was the public
demonstrationofaverydiﬀerentmodelfromtheleft-authoritarianSoviets. TheSoviets
had a state-controlled press, but America now had a press-controlled state.
After Watergate, the left-authoritarians knew that they were the boss of the boss, that
they could get the president ﬁred, that they could “hold someone accountable” — and,
conversely, that no one could really hold themaccountable in any way. For example,
what was the punishment for printing the “disinformation” that led to, say, the Iraq
War, or the Holodomor? Suspension from social media? Reparations for the dead? Or
nothing? Much easier to pin it all on a single Nixon, or even a Stalin for that matter,
than a decentralized mass of nameless left-authoritarians.
Two additional points before we move on from our God/State/Network-informed anal-
ysis of the left-authoritarians. First, more recently, as American state capacity has
declined, the left-authoritarians have shifted their targets to the new authorities: the
CEOs of tech companies in particular. They realize on some level that (a) Network >
State in many contexts and furthermore that (b) the Network-aided global ascent of
tech founders and populist leaders could reduce their control over the State, so they
have chosen to (c) strike ﬁrst by gaining control of those tech companies that have
achieved state-like scale.
Theirmodus operandi wasmuchthesameasitisforinﬂuencingtheState: usereporting
to harass tech executives into ﬁring people that left-authoritarians don’t like, then push
them to enact policies that left-authoritarians dolike — such as “content moderation”
over any message other than that emanating from approved establishment outlets. The
left-authoritarians have even admitted to this in unguarded moments; see for example
this character talking about how “journalism is about raw power” or this admission
that the media’s explicit goal was to use the State as a billy club against the Network
for fun and proﬁt.68 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Second, an important insight is that behind many of these left-authoritarian journalists
(andactivistsandnonproﬁts)isanold-moneyzillionaire, anepotisticheirofsomekind.
You won’t ﬁnd someone at The Atlantic criticizing Laurene Powell Jobs, you won’t ﬁnd
someoneatNPRgoingafterSoros, andyouwon’tﬁndsomeoneatTheNewYorkTimes
Company that even publicly admitsthat their boss, Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, is a rich
white male nepotist. This puts their behavior into stark relief: the left-authoritarian
wants to get you ﬁred, or get your boss to ﬁre you, but won’t even mention their boss.
They are fundamentally just dogs on a leash, hit men for old money, assassins for the
establishment.
Blue Network: Left-Libertarians
There is a split among blue Americans. Some of them, the left-libertarians, are actually
best modeled as people of the Network — meaning, the social network. They truly
aren’t primarily loyal to the Democrat party or even the institutions that are upstream
of it, but to their community online — which increasingly diverges from the party line.
These are the deplatformed sex workers, the ones engaging in risky public activism
rather than the ones merely funding it, the anarchists, the journalists so consistent
in their beliefs that they’re actually striking against their nepotistic owners, and the
ethical anti-imperialists. They really don’tidentify with the US establishment that
much, even if they sometimes wish it would execute the redistribution strategy of their
dreams. Their primary people are the others in their social network. And that Network
is becoming their new Leviathan.
For the professional protester, for example, they can use the oﬄine tactics from Beau-
tiful Trouble orRoots to Power to laboriously organize an in-person procession outside",1998
46,"a government oﬃce...or they can do the same thing online by simply posting a hash-
tag and materializing a digital crowd, then going direct with their cause rather than
negotiating with an establishment journalist for exposure. So what’s giving them more
leverage these days: the institutions that surround the legacy State, or the features of
the decentralized Network?
Another factor pushing left-libertarians away from the US establishment is the strong
left-authoritarian shift towards holiness over coolness. Fredrik DeBoer actually dis-
cussed this shift while it was underway, while society was still transitioning from the
old-time religion of Judeo-Christianity to the new doctrine of wokeness:
Silicon Valley types, by contrast, believe in things...Tangible values about
progress and culture. The Californian ideology plus the blockchain or what-
ever. There’s content there...
The media has none of that. The old school media values of truth telling
and muckraking have long since been abandoned by the media itself, as real
values require sincerity and media culture abhors sincerity. You can’t sit
on Twitter all day telling shitty jokes about how nothing matters and then
turn around and say “but also we’re the guardians of truth and democracy.”2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 69
If Silicon Valley has captured the value of media for shareholders and is
slowly strangling the industry to death, righting the course will require
people within media who are willing to stand up and say, “Here are my
values. They are what they are. I embody them without irony and thus I
am vulnerable. If you value these things too you have to ﬁght to save our
industry.” Suchapositionwouldrequireawillingnesstoleaveblanksarcasm
aside and to start writing again for the world instead of only writing to
appear clever to other writers. Can the media make this kind of move? I
don’t see how they can; the social capture of the entire industry is just far
too acute.
As smart as this post was, things didn’t work out quite as DeBoer expected. The push
toward sincerity — towards ﬁlling that God-shaped hole — ended up cleaving the blues
in two.
That is, contra DeBoer’s forecast (“I don’t see how they can”), some of the earnest
blues actually diddeclare themselves champions of “moral clarity”, and have now gone
over purely to unironic State-worship, to applauding multi-day prayer vigils with Liz
Cheney for the wrongs visited upon their sacred Capitol. As Glenn Greenwald has
written about at length, there’s no daylight anymore between the Democrats and the
Department of Defense, no criticism of the Central Intelligence Agency by CNN.
This fusion wasn’t the full communism that DeBoer sometimes claims to prefer, but it
was a fulsome declaration of values by the medianevertheless. It’s the culmination of
the trend towards devout wokeness that Scott Alexander identiﬁed years ago in “Gay
Rites are Civil Rites.” The left-authoritarians have done to wokeness in a few years
what Nietzsche noted had been done to Christianity over the span of eons: namely,
they’ve transformed it from a revolutionary ideology into a ruling-class ideology.
But every action has a reaction, every activity spawns a Soros-like reﬂexivity, and Scott
Alexander was actually ahead of the curve again here as well. Before “Gay Rites are
Civil Rites”, he also identiﬁed a second dynamic of relevance, the trend awayfrom
devout wokeness that he described in “Right is the new Left.” And this brings us to
back to the left-libertarians.
The kind of blue that listens to Gray Zone, Red Scare, or Jimmy Dore is repelled by
State worship. They don’t wantto choose something as down the middle as pledging
allegiancetotheAmericanﬂagandthenationalsecuritystateforwhichitstands. They
actually believed the things they said against the establishment, and don’t endorse it
simply because it’s ostensibly “their” team now wearing the NSA headsets.70 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Blue State vs Blue Network
The left-libertarian subgroup of blues has begun to ﬂirt with decentralized media and
web3, because they’re realizing the Network could be more interesting than the declin-
ing American State. Could Substack be more remunerative than Sulzberger? Could
Satoshi’s community deliver more for them than Bernie’s? If they need to redeﬁne
all that as “socialism,” so be it! And if their funding stream is changing, their ide-
ology is slowly shifting too. Yes, they may have startedas mere pawns of America’s
left-authoritarian establishment, but what they value is increasingly coming from the
decentralized global Network rather than the centralized American State. So they are
beginning to uncouple. And that’s the emerging Network-vs-State division within blue
tribe.
Red Tribe: Secular Nationalists, Internationalist Capitalists
Each member of red tribe, the conservatives, will also have to make a choice in the
years to come: do they believe in the founding principles encoded in the Bill of Rights
and the Constitution, or will they simply enforce whatever edicts emanate from an
increasingly malign US establishment — supporting statists in practice? Is their def-
inition of “America” commensurate with a world where the US federal government is
itself the most determined opponent of liberty, inﬂating away their savings, decon-
structing conservative America’s culture, and surveilling them at all times? Or do they
believe American cities and states deserve digital self-determination? In short, will the
American nationchoose the decentralized Network or the centralized State?
This will eventually be a conscious choice. Right now, it’s an unconscious three-way
split. The three-legged stool of Reaganism — the religious conservatives, the secu-
lar nationalists, and the internationalist capitalists — side with the God, State, and
Network Leviathans respectively.
These are their primary identities, because they correspond to that thing which they
think of as the most powerful force in the world: almighty God, the US military, or
(implicitly) the global network of trade and communication that will soon simply be
identiﬁed with cryptocurrency.
Red God: Religious Conservatives
During the Cold War, religious conservatives believed in an almighty God, unlike the
“godless communists” they fought against. Today, the people of God among the reds
have sharply reduced numbers, but their moral compass remains the man on high.
Insofar as there is a religious revival, it may be driven by the One Commandment-
based startup societies we describe later on. See Rod Dreher on the Protestants,
Adrian Vermeule and Sohrab Ahmari on the Catholics, and Tablet’s Big Tent to get a
sense of their views.2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 71
Red State: Secular Nationalists
The people of the State among the reds are more prominent. These are the secu-
lar nationalists, the national security hawks, the people who may not like the left-
authoritarians but who will nevertheless reﬂexively support the US in every foreign
intervention. They may agree that the US is trending in a bad direction, but they
think China is far worse. As such, they’re still building drones, coding surveillance,
andcheeringvideoslikethisonewheretheUSadmitstofomentingthecolorrevolutions
that are often otherwise denied.
I’m somewhat sympathetic to this group — after all, they aren’t burning their own
country down! — but unfortunately, on foreign policy they are helping to burn down
otherpeople’s countries, and often for no good reason.
The issue is that in the absence of a compelling alternative, or an undeniable collapse,
you’re simply not going to convince a secular nationalist that America and China are
bothbecoming digital totalitarian states, or that a US establishment that has pushed
half a dozen countries into murderous chaos isn’t quite the moral exemplar that they
think it is.
The reason is becausethe red statist is a secular nationalist: they don’t have a God,
but they do believe in the State, the good vision of America as a shining city on a hill.
It really doesn’t matter if this doesn’t exist — it’s the USA from their youth and from
their movies. It’s Top Gun",1997
47,"America, and they’ll keep paying to watch the inspiring
remakes, not the depressing footage of what the US military actually did in Iraq, Libya,
Afghanistan, and Syria.
There’s both a laudable aspect to this kind of loyalty, and a frustrating one. These
folks are like the Soviet soldiers that dutifully served in Afghanistan. You might argue
they’re ﬁghting for a cause that is at best pointless and at worst evil, and that they’ll
only come home to ﬁnd their shelves empty and their culture crushed...but you have
to acknowledge they’re risking their lives regardless.
Fundamentally, the red secular nationalist often understands how bad the US estab-
lishment is at home, but doesn’t want to hear about the needless destruction wreaked
by the US military abroad. In this they have the opposite set of blind spots from the
blue left-libertarian, who can clearly see the ruin of countries unfortunate enough to
experience a 21st century US “intervention,” yet imagines the same government that’s
a chaotic destroyer abroad can become a benevolent redistributor at home.
In other words, while the red secular nationalist maintains an implicit Hollywood-
movie-style belief in a US military that can beat up anyone, the blue left-libertarian
persists in their belief that the State’s civilian government couldﬁx anything at home
if only enough people willed it. Using the lens of the Leviathans, these are both clearly
waystheStatebecomesastand-inforGod, initsterribleFatherandbenevolentMother
forms respectively.72 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
What about China, huh?
Let’s digress and engage the China point for a second, as it’s the go-to argument of
the red secular nationalist. To paraphrase, the red nationalist often concedes that US
military intervention abroad has been regrettable, but CCP dominance would be so
much worse that we need the US military to not just stick around but to expand and
grow stronger.
The short counterargument is that it may instead be best for countries to rearm, and
take on their own defense – rather than having an increasingly chaotic US try to ﬁght
a Second Cold War on others’ behalf in the middle of an internal Cold Civil War and
what might become a Second Great Depression.
That is, we get there by a diﬀerent route, but we arrive at much the same conclusion as
an isolationist rightist or an anti-imperialist leftist. Whether you think America is too
good for the world, or whether you think it’s an ill eﬀect on countries abroad, or some
complex combination of both, we may want (and observe) US military withdrawal and
regional rearmament rather than a Second Cold War.
What’s the long-form version of the argument? Start with the observation that the
CCPismore oppressive at home than the US establishment, but it’s also empirically
less destructive abroad.
Why? Not because of benevolence, but because the CCP is checked by the US military
abroad. Thus China is focused on building up Africa while America is blowing up the
Middle East. Yes, you can argue the Chinese are building colonies in Africa...but
they’re functional colonies, with new roads and ports to carry raw materials, unlike the
blasted hellscapes left by US military intervention in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and the like.
With that said, we should have no illusions: China’s neighbors in Southeast Asia know
the dragon would throw its weight around without a US military presence. Right now
it can’t, because China is boxed in by the US military. Conversely, at home the CCP
has no organized domestic political opposition, so it can be absolutely ruthless.
The US establishment has the opposite set of constraints: unlike China, it doesn’t face
organized military opposition abroad, so it’s highly incautious in its foreign policy. But
also unlike the CCP it doesface organized domestic political opposition at home, so it
can’t be as ruthless domestically as it wantsto be.
Let’s drill into the domestic point ﬁrst, and then the military point.
It’s really crucial to understand that the US establishment is notmore ethical than
the CCP when it comes to civil liberties. It’s just less competent! After all, the US
establishment also does warrantless surveillance via the NSA, unconstitutional search
andseizureviatheTSA,arbitraryconﬁscationofpropertyviacivilforfeiture, andsoon.
And that’s just what’s already been rolled out — the ambitions of the US establishment
are just as totalitarian as the Chinese state’s, as we can see from its partially failed
attempts at disinformation agencies, civilian disarmament, digital censorship, and the
like. Up to this point, these pushes have not been thwarted by the “ethics” of the2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 73
US establishment, but by some combination of political opposition, Constitutional
constraint, and bureaucratic incompetence.
They keep trying, though. The US establishment isn’t organized enough to coordinate
all the pieces, but unfortunately the recently captured Google, Amazon, Apple, and
Microsoft arecapable of that level of coordination, as we saw during the Parler deplat-
forming, and the Tiananmen-like censorship of the “whistleblower.” So we’ll see what
happens.
Now on the military point.
During the Cold War, the Soviet constraint meant the US was more cautious in its
interventions, and actually generally achieved far better results. South Korea was
better oﬀ than North Korea, West Germany was better oﬀ than East Germany, and
Taiwan was better oﬀ than Maoist China. Even given all the lies on all sides around
Vietnam, had the US won in South Vietnam, it’s quite possible that would have been
a South Korea too; but because it lost, countless people had to ﬂee and communism
claimed many lives in Southeast Asia.
After the Cold War ended, however, the US military became a hyperpower - and
gradually evolved into a global fomenter of chaos rather than the generally conservative
guardian of stability it was before 1991. The Iraq War can be seen as a transition point,
ascanSamanthaPower’sR2PdoctrinethatleftSyriainruins. By2022, thequestionof
whether America produces chaos with its military interventions can hardly be gainsaid
— even the most committed American nationalist is hard pressed to name a country
that’sbetteroﬀ after a recentUS military intervention, something that wasn’t that
hard to do from 1945-1991.
OK, so let’s put it all together.
Thereistruth to the idea that the US military is checking China, and that China
would act more aggressively in the absence of the US military...but it’s true in the
same way the Soviet military was once checking the US, and then the US military
acted more aggressively in the absence of the Soviet military. That is, it’s true that
the Soviet military was on balance nota force for good during 1945-1991, but it’s also
true that the US military has on balance notbeen a force for good during 1991-2021.
It’scomplicated. EveniftheirmilitarydidinsomesenserestraintheUSfromrandomly
blowing up the Middle East, it’s tough to argue that you’d still want the Soviet Union
to still be around to limit US military intervention. Similarly, it’s hard to contend that
the price of constraining China’s lawful evil ambitions in East Asia should be tolerance
for America’s chaotic evil interventions in the Middle East, that defending against a74 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
potential Chinese drone armada should mean acceptance of endless destabilization by
the US military.
Ideallythere’sathirdway, abetterchoice-andthatthirdwaymaysimplybe decentral-
ized defense , where countries like Japan and Germany re-arm, rather than outsourcing
everything to the US or folding to China. This has its own issues, of course — but if
we’re moving back into the 1800s and 1700s, as per the Future is Our Past thesis, lim-
ited wars between gold-limited great powers are arguably preferable to gigantic global
conﬂicts between unlimited superpowers.
In short: the secular American nationalist has an option that doesn’t involve either
capitulating to China or pretending the US military is currently achieving fruitful
things abroad. That third way is to support regional rearmament rather than ﬁghting
everyone else’s wars on their behalf.
Red Network: Internationalist Capitalists",1999
48,"Getting back to our original topic, the third group within red tribe are the interna-
tionalist capitalists. We identify them as people of the Network. This is arguably
something of a retcon, because the internet as we currently know it was barely a factor
during the Cold War.However, this subgroup involved the folks in favor of commerce
and trade networks, both within and across borders — the capitalists.
Today, that kind of capitalism is almost synonymous with internet startups and tech-
nology. The most valuable companies in the world were born on the Network. And
the future of network capitalism is crypto-capitalism, because it’s not just transactions
that can be represented on-chain — it’s entire ﬁnancial statements, and companies
themselves, and eventually the entire economy.
The rise of Bitcoin means red people of the Network have a very speciﬁc way to think
about their Leviathan, something distinct from both God and the State. Because BTC
cannot be seized with one click by either the US or Chinese governments, it’s a symbol
of international freedom and prosperity that is more powerful than any State.
On balance, I’m sympathetic to this group as well, but it has its own internal issues.
For one thing, Bitcoin Maximalism in particular is similar to Woke Capital in its funda-
mentalism. The main diﬀerence is that maximalism is zealous mononumism (devotion
to a single coin) rather than monotheism (a single god) or monostatism (a single state).
The Network doesn’t make the fanatical aspect of humanity vanish; it just moves it
from God or the State to the Network.
Red State vs Red Network
We now see that the God, State, and Network Leviathans all have their supporters
within the conservative movement.2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 75
An interesting point is that secular nationalists, being dispositionally conservative, can
often stick with a symbol long after its substance has changed. Think about the many
“Russian nationalists” who stuck with the Soviet Union even when it was a complete
inversion of what had existed prior to 1917. Then compare this US Army ad from 2008
with this recent ad from 2021.
So, in the event of any conﬂict between the Network and the State, such as a possible
struggle between the inﬂating dollar and the deﬂationary Bitcoin, the right-statists
could take the side of the national ﬂag while the right-capitalists take the side of the
digital currency. That is, if and when it’s clear that the continuation of American
empire depends on the ability to continually inﬂate, the people of the State may side
with the legacy state, and the people of the Network will side with the decentralized
network.So, that’s the Network-vs-State division within red tribe.
The Realignment
If we add up all these pieces, we get a possible future where the left- and right-
libertarians from both parties line up against the left- and right-authoritarians.
We’re already starting to see this if we look at Substack vs establishment journal-
ists, Tucker Carlson and Glenn Greenwald vs Fox News/NYT, BTC vs USD, web3 vs
Big Tech, the migration of ethnic minorities to the Republicans and the migration of
neoconservatives to the Democrats.
People have talked about zombie Reaganism, but in this scenario a new coalition would
be ﬁnally popping into view. And it’s a totally diﬀerent carving of the political spec-
trum than the Reagan era. Rather than nationalists and capitalists (the right) against
internationalists and socialists (the left), it’s internationalists and capitalists (left- and
right-libertarians) against socialists and nationalists (left- and right-authoritarians).
That Realignment would be the Network against the State. The authoritarians would
outnumber the libertarians domestically, and have the institutions on their side. But
the libertarians would have stronger individual talent, as they’d draw the iconoclasts,
and they’d also draw support from the rest of the world.",938
49,"2.5.2 Tech vs Media, aka PC vs PC
Let’s switch gears here and apply the lens of the Leviathans to a diﬀerent conﬂict.
Why are global technology and the US establishment at odds?
•Economics. You can say it’s because technology disrupted everything from Madi-
son Avenue to Hollywood, as argued here. Looking at just the 80% drop in US76 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
media revenue alone from 2008 to 2012, it’s hard to believe that wasn’t a factor.
•Geography. You could note that the pre-2020 center of technology was Silicon
Valley, which is 3000 miles away from the Bos-Wash corridor that houses the US
establishment.
•Demographics. You can claim it’s because tech is largely immigrant and the US
establishment is 20-30 points whiter. Certainly by the high evidentiary standards
ofAmerica’sleadingdisparateimpactanalystsandcriticalracetheorists, thisfact
alone is prima facie evidence that the US establishment is institutionally racist
towards their tech disruptors.
•Psychology. Youcancontendit’sduetoapsychologicaldiﬀerencebetweentechni-
cal/ﬁnancial types vs social/political elites, between people who focus on what is
true versus those who care about what is popular. This relates to the distinction
between technical and political truths.
•Metabolism. You might observe that the rivalry is particularly pronounced be-
tweenUStechandmedia. TheotherarmsoftheUSestablishment, likeacademia,
Hollywood, and government all needed multi-year cycles to ship anything, while
only the news media had the 24/7 metabolism to match tech’s DNA. So they
became the point of the spear for the US establishment’s counterattack. This
is also why tech favors newsletters, podcasts, slide decks, and other types of
fast-turnaround content that the establishment doesn’t natively specialize in.
•Bifurcation. You can remark that there’s a deep structural similarity between
a socialist professor and technologist founder: both feel like they should be in
charge. That’s why tech is a cultural fork of the US establishment, just as the
US itself was a fork of the British Empire. It’s the same root, diﬀerent branches.
The ambitious intellectual who would in a previous life have become an academic
theorist, jurist, or journalist is now a founder, engineer, or investor.Because
there’s a common thread between media and tech, which is the handling and
presentation of information. Computer science took it one step further: it col-
lapsed the distinction between the word and the deed, and turned a generation
of intellectuals into software CEOs. Many people who previously thought they’d
just advocate for a law to be passed and not worry about the details found out
how hard it was to build things, to manage people, to turn a proﬁt, to be the
one in the arena. They became people of the Network. And then they came into
conﬂict with those who remained people of the State.
All of these are factors. But the last one probably gets to the root of the issue, because
fundamentally, tech-vs-media is a clash of Leviathans.2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 77
After all, the immigrant technologist moves betweencountries while keeping their tech-
nical skills and network connections. For them, the Network provides their primary
community, while the State is secondary. Conversely, the American establishmentarian
gains their power from the State. It is all about passing a law or inﬂuencing a pol-
icymaker. And if the Network interferes with this process, perhaps by giving people
access to information that undermines the State? Then so much for the Network.
Tech-vs-media is then best understood as a collision of fundamental values, between
the people of the Network and the people of the State.
The Conﬂict: Technological Progressives vs Technological Conservatives
You can think of the “people of the Network” as technological progressives, and the
“people of the State” as political progressives (charitably) or technological conservatives
(perhaps more realistically).
Bothareseeminglyalignedatahighlevelonthegoalofsolvingproblemslikecontrolling
COVID-19, building housing, or reducing car crashes. But the people of the Network
usually start by writing code and thinking about individual volition, whereas for the
people of the State the ﬁrst recourse is passing laws and collective coercion.
Put another way, the people of the Network start by thinking about getting a piece
of the network to call their own. A domain name, something they can build up from
scratch, starting with a bare website like reddit.com and ending up with a massive
online destination that everyone voluntarily seeks out. The primary goal of the tech-
nological progressive, the tech founder is to build — and for no one to have power over
them.
By contrast the people of the State start by thinking about capturing a piece of the
state. To win an election, to inﬂuence legislation via a nonproﬁt, to write an article
that has “impact” in the sense of impacting policy, to be appointed Undersecretary of
something or other...this is their mindset. The goal is to get a piece of this gigantic
baton that is the government, to get a club to coerce people (for their own good of
course), to maybe get a little budget along the way, and to ﬁnally “change the world”
by changing the policy. To make something that was previously discretionary either
mandatory or forbidden, to redirect the ﬂow of printed money, to exert force through
the law. The primary goal of the political progressive is thus the opposite of the
technological progressive: their goal, verbalized or not, conscious or not, is to exert
power over others.
Now, this is a caricature. Of course there are good people of the State, just like there
are bad people of the Network. It is possible to use a minimal amount of coercion for
good against genuinely bad actors; this truth is the diﬀerence between minarchism and
anarchism.
But obviously, these worldviews collide. One group wants no one to have power over
them, while the other seeks to exert power over others.78 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
As a possible future scenario, one way this could be resolved is if the people of the
State use the law to smash American tech over the 2020s, thereby gaining more power
domestically. But tech has already gone global thanks to remote work, and most
technologists are immigrants already...so the people of the Network may simply shift
their attention overseas — or not come in the ﬁrst place. So the federal action would
merely drives away immigrant founders, and the American State would lose power on
a global scale. (Local and state governments in the US may respond diﬀerently, which
is an intriguing twist).
The same thing is also happening in China, by the way, where many of the most able
technologists are now alighting for new countries — and no longer coming to the US,
where they aren’t welcome anyway.
The Enormous State, not the Entrepreneurial State
As a bit of a sidebar, a frequent argument that American people of the State make is
thatthepeopleoftheNetworkowetheirvery existence totheState. Afterall, wasitnot
their god, the US government, that funded the internet? Do we not need public monies
to back basic research? And shouldn’t the people of the Network therefore dutifully
bow their heads and submit, joyfully paying ever more in tribute to the sacred Uncle
Sam?
There are a few responses to this. One is that the antecedent of the people of the
Network were the pre-internet industrialists, who certainly were not well treated by
the State in the early 1900s. Another is that while the UK similarly gave rise to the
US insomesense, Americans do not genuﬂect in the direction of the British Isles ﬁve
times per day.
But the deepest response starts by acknowledging a kernel of truth: there wasa period
from roughly 1933-1970 when the centralized US government did the Hoover Dam, the
Manhattan Project, and Apollo. The transistor and early internet came out of this era
as well. And there were some later innovations also catalyzed by the State (albeit often
by non-bureaucrats who managed to commandeer bureaucrat funds) like the Human
Genome Project and the self-driving car.
However, both before andafter this period, the centralized State was not the locus",1983
50,"of technical and scientiﬁc innovation. That should be obvious today for anything in
digitaltechnology; academiahasbeenraidedbytechcompaniesandventurecapitalists.
But it’s also true for the period beforethe (well-intentioned) Vannevar Bush memo
that kicked oﬀ the government centralization of science. After all, most of physics —
from Newton to Maxwell to Einstein — was discovered before the National Science
Foundation (NSF) was even created.
That said, let’s talk about the 1933-1970 period itself. This period of “peak state”
was real, but in overstated form it has become the basis for books like Mazzucato’s
Entrepreneurial State — which I disagree with, and which Mingardi and McCloskey
have rebutted at length in the Myth of the Entrepreneurial State .2.5. PEOPLE OF GOD, PEOPLE OF THE STATE, PEOPLE OF THE NETWORK 79
Here’s why I disagree with the thesis of the Entrepreneurial State :
•The name itself is oxymoronic. As macroeconomists never tire of telling us,
governments aren’t households, because unlike actual entrepreneurs the state
can seize funds and print money. So there is no ﬁnancial risk, and hence nothing
of “entrepreneurship” in the entrepreneurial state.
•The book doesn’t consider the fact that most math/physics/etc was invented
prior to the founding of NSF, and therefore doesn’t need NSF to exist.
•It further doesn’t acknowledge that it was possibleto do science and technology
before the massive centralized state, through the distributed model of the “gen-
tleman scientist,” and that this model is returning in the form of open source and
(now) decentralized science.
•It doesn’t take into account the waxing and waning of centralized state capacity
due to technology.
•It doesn’t contend with the state-caused slowdown in physical world innovation
that happened during the post-1970 period, which Thiel, Cowen, and J Storrs
Hall have all documented.
•It doesn’t look at how diﬃcult VC or angel investing actually is, so it doesn’t
really ask whether those “investments” by the state had real returns.
•Most importantly, it doesn’t engage with the counterfactual of what would hap-
pen if we had many independent funding sources, rather than a single centralized
state.
So, it’s true that there was a period mid-century where all other actors besides the US
and USSR were squashed down and centralized states dominated innovation. But it’s
not because they were necessarily better at innovating , it’s because they were better at
dominating , due to the centralized tech of that time. It was more about the Enormous
State than the Entrepreneurial State. And that’s why the technological progressives of
the Network don’t reﬂexively genuﬂect before the political progressives of the State.",692
51,"2.5.3 The Base-Rater as a Flat-Curver
Someone who worships an almighty God won’t readily change their beliefs. Neither
will someone who worships an almighty State.
Once in a while, a religious millenarian’s belief is put to the test when there’s a concrete
prediction made by the faith that doesn’t pan out. That’s also what happened for the
“secular” believers in communism when the Berlin Wall and then the Soviet Union
fell. These events are always fascinating for the non-believer - whether it’s Heaven’s
Gate, QAnon, “Mueller Day,” or the “withering of the state”, it’s interesting to see what
happens when a prophecy doesn’t work out.80 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Indeed, that’s why people wrote books like The God that Failed when they turned away
from communism. A Leviathan had given up the ghost. Whether that Leviathan was
God itself or the State, it was a crushing collapse of faith. As per the book of the same
title,Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More .
This oﬀers a useful way of thinking about the blue and red statists alike, the left-
authoritarians and the secular nationalists we discussed earlier. The American State is
their God replacement, and they truly can’t envision a world without it. Whether they
think of it in terms of “the Constitution” (the conservative framing) or “our democracy”
(the progressive framing), the civic religion of the US istheir religion, especially when
faith in God has fallen oﬀ a cliﬀ.
So, they may not be dispassionately rational when forecasting whether their God, the
State, might fail. There are three ideas that are helpful here.
•The ﬁrst idea is Flatland. The premise of Flatland is that it’s a 2D plane,
and entities within Flatland can’t really understand 3D things. They encounter
spheres as circles that start as points, expand to their maximum radus, and then
contract back down.
•The second idea is the premise that historical time is far longer than human time.
We live on a tiny piece of a grand historical curve, a trajectory that looks ﬂat to
us over months and years, because historical time (usually) moves slowly.
•The third idea is what Tyler Cowen diplomatically calls a “base-rater”, the es-
tablishment type who essentially thinks everything remains constant. This is the
kind of person who’ll sardonically remarks “Oh, this time is diﬀerent, huh?”, not
realizing that (a) they’re quoting that statement out of context, and (b) the ob-
viously fallacious opposite of that saying is the assertion that “things will never
change.”
Put these ideas together and you start to get a mental model of the base-raters, the
blue and red statists. They think everything will always stay the same, that it’ll stick
at a base rate.
The only cycles they’re familiar with are short ones: the cycle of breath over a few
seconds, the cycle of sleep over one day, and the cycle of seasons over one year. But
they aren’t familiar with any cycle that extends beyond one human life, because they
usually don’t know much history beyond what the establishment has pointed them
towards.
Because they don’t think about cycles, they don’t think about curves. They live on a
kind of Flatland, except rather than being ﬂat as in the sense of two-dimensional, it’s
ﬂat as in the sense of a curve with zero-derivative. But as Ray Dalio has noted, things
may not stay ﬂat in historical terms for long. As such, the blue and red statists may2.6. IF THE NEWS IS FAKE, IMAGINE HISTORY 81
be in for a rude shock. Using the lens of the Leviathans, they really think their God,
the State, can never fail.",954
52,"2.6 If the News is Fake, Imagine History
The collision of Leviathans has knocked something loose. Access to all that information
from the Network has changed our perception of the present, and with it the perception
of the past. The historical inevitability and (even more importantly) the desirability of
the US establishment’s victory over all opponents is now very much in question. Both
outside and inside the US, there’s the sense that the US-dominated postwar order is
either on its last legs or already over, and that the ancient legislators and endless
remakes reﬂect a fading culture trying to hang on by its ﬁngernails to prevent what
comes next.
Though people are gearing up as if on autopilot for a Second Cold War, it’s not obvious
that the US will make it out of the ﬁrst round given its internal Cold Civil War. The
decline in state capacity, in internal alignment, in budgetary resources, in wherewithal,
andinpoliticalwillistangible. It’struethatthemostdedicatedestablishmentariansdo
still operate as if the empire will always be there. But the question of what America’s
role in the world should be next remains unanswered, because the question of what
America represents at home remains unanswered.
Within the US, groups on both right and left are now asking themselves in diﬀerent
ways: are we the baddies? The left asks whether the US is institutionally racist, the
right asks whether the US is irredeemably leftist, and more factions on each sidewant
a national divorce.
As we can see from the graphs, America is not really a single “nation state” anymore;
it’satleastbinational, withtwowarringgroups. There’sbeenacollapseininstitutional
trust, and in each other. And the questions now arising are fundamental.
•Is the US establishment a force for good in the world?
•Is the US establishment a force for good at home?
•Would others copy today’s America of their own free will?
•Would the US establishment tell you the truth?
•Was itevera force for good at home or abroad?82 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
My perhaps idiosyncratic answers to these questions are: no, no, no, no, and yes. No, I
don’t think the US establishment is nowadays on balance a force for good abroad or at
home, or that the US model would be cloned today by someone setting up a new state,
or that the US establishment can be trusted to tell the truth. I do, however, think the
Cold War America of 1945-1991 was on balance better for its citizens and allies than
its Soviet opponents.
But while I can justifythese answers, my responses aren’t as important as why these
questions are arising in the ﬁrst place. The reason is that the US establishment has
lost control over the narrative. The distortion of the present, and the past, has caught
up to them.",674
53,"2.6.1 Distortion of the Present
“If the news is fake, imagine history.” This pithy tweet reverses Orwell, because he who
is acknowledged to be faking the present can no longer distort the past. That is, once
enough people see that the establishment has been lying about today’s events, they
naturally begin to think the establishment might have been lying about yesterday’s
news as well.
To calibrate this, let’s start with a grab bag of media failures from the recent present,
the last 5-15 years or so. You’ll no doubt have your own list.
•Remember the “oops” on the Iraq War, after the media corporations that were
supposedto“holdthegovernmentaccountable” insteadhelpedjustifytheinvasion
of Iraq under false pretenses?
•Remember the thousands of reports on “Russiagate” that completely disappeared
after the Mueller report?
•Remember when the NYT said Hillary Clinton had a 91% chance to win, giving
the strong impression that the 2016 election wasn’t even close?
•Remember the detailed, emotional, multipart Caliphate podcast, endorsed by
Sam Dolnick, a senior member of The New York Times Company’s ruling Ochs-
Sulzberger family, which turned out to be completely fake?
•Remember the Miles Taylor episode, where a junior functionary was falsely rep-
resented as a senioradministration oﬃcial?
•RememberwhenSulzberger’semployeespublishededitorialaftereditorialagainst
free speech, before they pretended they were for it, before they opposed it again?
•Remember when they said YouTube’s remaining freedom of speech was a bad
thing in the US, and then praised its freedom of speech the next day when it was
helpful in getting their content into Russia?2.6. IF THE NEWS IS FAKE, IMAGINE HISTORY 83
•Remember when Kara Swisher reported that innocent high school student Nick
Sandmann had done something wrong for merely standing still in front of a man
who strode up to him pounding a drum?
•Remember when Kara Swisher’s Recode also said COVID-19 was “contained,”
before it ended up killing more than a million Americans?
•Remember all the oﬃcial disinformation on COVID, how they called people
racists for warning about it, and said that masks didn’t work before they did?
•Remember when everyone switched sides on vaccines, and everything else related
to COVID, as Michael Solana ably chronicled here?
•Remember when the US establishment published reports credulously predicting
that inﬂation would be transitory?
•And remember when there was minimal mainstream coverage of the 2017 battle
for Mosul, the world’s largest military operation since the invasion of Iraq in 2003,
the war that Obama was supposed to have ended?
You probably didn’t remember that last one, mainly because there wasminimal cov-
erage, but watch this and then ask why you’ve never heard of it before.
In each of these cases, we have something predicted to go to zero that ends up at
millions, or a certainty that winds up a nullity, or a hot war featuring the US military
and 482 suicide car bombings that somehow registered on the public consciousness as
zero.
If the US establishment could erase Mosul from memory in the age of the internet,
you start to see how Putin’s Russia could pretend the 2022 invasion of Ukraine was
just a “special operation.” And you start to realize that it’s not suﬃcient to simply
“take the articles with a grain of salt”, and discount them a bit. By listening to the
establishment, your perception of reality may be oﬀ by one million fold.
Patterns of Information Distortion
There are a few common patterns here, ways in which the information supply chain
has been distorted.
Channel distortion. That which favors the US establishment is magniﬁed 100X, while
that which disfavors it is downranked 100X or silenced entirely, such that the net
distortion is 10,000X or more. We can think of this as analogous to channel distortion
in signal processing. Media corporations aren’t just censors, they’re sensors- and
self-interested ones. That is, they’re ostensibly measuring the world, but they actually
have self-interested reasons for reporting that some numbers are low (like inﬂation and
crime) and others are high (like whatever social ill they want to address). There are
many such channel distortions, including (a) absence of criticism of media owners, (b)
A/B testing to promote literal hate speech for more clicks, (c) self-referential quoting
to give the impression of impartiality, and so on.84 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Narrative alignment. The way the establishment determines what to put on the front
page out of millions of possible stories should remind you of the political power theory
of history. It’s only things that support the narrative: their favored state policies
will always succeed, their disfavored tech competitors will always fail, their errors are
honest mistakes, your errors are ﬁring oﬀenses, the opponents of the establishment are
x-ists and traitors, free speech is the enemy, and so on. Quantitatively speaking, it’d be
relatively straightforward to use word2vec or something more recent to literally score
and rank stories for their narrative alignment.
Power over truth. In these incidents, if you stop to count, you often realize that the
reports were oﬀ not by say 50%, but by 1000X or more. Why do these “reporters” still
have their jobs, then? Because their job wasn’t to make money, but to make power.
That is, they weren’t trying to predict the future correctly for the sake of making good
investments, but to repeat the party line to keep people in line. They’re like actors, in
that their role was to say (or write) the right thing at the right time, to manufacture
your consent, to misinform you about everything from weapons of mass destruction to
the probability of inﬂation, and to then claim democratic legitimacy after people voted
on the basis of their oﬃcial misinformation.
Comparison to an aligned sensor. It’s worth comparing the reports by these media
corporations to reports by an aligned sensor, one where there is no way for the sensor
to “win” at your expense by distorting the information it’s giving to you. Your gas
tank does not report that the gas is at 90% before suddenly dropping to 20%. Your
bank account does not zoom up in order to fake you out and get you to buy something
from the bank, and then silently down again, like an establishment journalist trying to
manipulate someone before an election. The metrics on your dashboard at work are
not typically falsiﬁed by people to make them more sensational. In each of these cases,
you are receiving reports from either a dispassionate machine or an institution (like
your company) where you have economic alignment and no signiﬁcant principal/agent
issues. By contrast, the media corporation can report false information to you and still
make money; it has a mind and wallet of its own, unlike the sensors you own.
Network rescue. Note something else: the onlyreason you are hearing about these
incidents, and the only reason the rebuttals to them ever came out in the ﬁrst place, is
the Network. It is only because the State’s ﬁltering of social media is not yet complete,

attempttoimposespeechandthoughtcontrolsonafreesocietynotfullyconsummated,
that (a) the initial refutations were even published and (b) that you are seeing some
of them combined into one document.
This last point is worth hovering on. Why do we know about these distortions of the
present? It’s again because of a collision of Leviathans, because the Network routed
information around the State, giving people actualrather than ostensible freedom of
speech.2.6. IF THE NEWS IS FAKE, IMAGINE HISTORY 85
The Network Delivered Actual Freedom of Speech
We elaborate on this in the Fragmentation Thesis , but the Network is accelerating a
great decentralization of Western society that began shortly after the peak centraliza-
tion of about 1950.
Towards the end of this process, in our current era, the US establishment got so fat
and happy that it forgot how aggressive its predecessors had been in imposing speech
and thought controls. Basically, the establishment didn’t realize they’d inherited a
highly regulated, centralized communications apparatus where the vast majority of",1992
54,"Americans had no practical freedom of speech unless they owned a media corporation
or were employed by one.
As such, in the 1990s and 2000s, the American establishment could seem to eat its cake
and have it too — enjoying the rhetorical windfall of claiming to have a free society,
while in practice holding an enormous distribution advantage over the common man
(“never argue with a man who buys ink by the barrel”).
Now, itwastrue that the US was more free than the USSR, but it is not true that
the US was more free than the Internet. As we discuss later, social media is Amer-
icanglasnost and cryptocurrency is American perestroika . So as the internet scaled,
and Americans actually got the rights to free speech and free markets that they were
nominally promised, the establishment started to feel threatened.
Why? Because while speech only inﬂuences volitional behavior (like voting), volitional
behavior in turn inﬂuences coercive behavior (like legislating). So, if the US establish-
ment lost control over speech they would have lost control over everything.
The Establishment Launched the Counter-Decentralization
Thus began the great Counter-Decentralization in 2013, the techlash plus the Great
Awokening, what Jack Bratich calls a “war of restoration” by an establishment that
had been economically disrupted by the Network but that retained the capability to
morally denounce its enemies.
The threatened US establishment increased the volume of attacks on their rivals in
both senses of the term; the sheer quantity of attacks and the level of vitriol soared,
as you can see from the charts. Their rivals were basically everyone — tech, Trump,
China, Russia, Israel, Brazil, Hungary, Brexiteers, Macron — everyone that wasn’t a
loyal part of the US establishment’s social network.
And from 2013-2020, against all odds, this multifront campaign seemed to be working.
America’s establishment spent down huge amounts of reputation, but they managed to
wokify Google, Amazon, Apple, and the major tech companies, deplatform Trump and
get him out of oﬃce, and terrorize the country with massive riots. They completely
reversed coursefrom the Obama era, silently stole the China issue from Trump,86 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
and polarized relations with Russia. They canceled, deplatformed, demonized, and
dominated for the better part of a decade.
Then, suddenly, after February 2021, there was a distinct slackening of support, of
intensity. The coalition that had predated Trump, that had arguably caused Trump,
didn’t seem to outlive Trump. At the time of writing, it’s hard to tell whether this is
a momentary shift or a permanent one, but social engagement is down. People have
tuned out. The US establishment is only talking to their hardcore supporters now. All
the other social networks they’ve attacked — essentially everyone in the world who
isn’t a true blue American State-worshipper — they aren’t listening anymore.
Instead, they’re reassessing their relationship with the US establishment, and with the
US itself.",711

The distortion of America’s present has led people to re-evaluate America’s past. Once
theyrealizethey’vehadGell-MannAmnesia, theystarttowonderiftheirmentalmodel
is one of Gell-Mann America.
Recall that Gell-Mann Amnesia refers to the phenomenon where you read something
in the paper about an area you have independent knowledge of. Suppose it’s computer
science. Whenyoureadarticlesonthetopic, youseegrievousfalsehoods, andinversions
of cause and eﬀect. Then you turn the page and read about, say, Palestine as if the
reporting on that topic was trustworthy. You forget what you just saw, that the
reporting was ﬂawed in the area where you could independently check it. You get
amnesia.
The mechanistic reason for Gell-Mann Amnesia is the hub-and-spoke topology of the
pre-internetinformationenvironment. Supposeyouwereanexpertincomputerscience,
another person was an expert on Japan, a third knew about the bond market, and so
on. You are spokes that are all connected to the hub (say, The New York Times)
but not each other. Each spoke has superior local information, and can falsify NYT
reports in their own domain, but has no mechanism for coordinating with other spokes,
let alone establishing a superior hub. Until the internet, the blockchain, and the advent
of cryptohistory.
The long-term consequence of Gell-Mann Amnesia is Gell-Mann America. People know
now that we are systematically misled about the present. But at least we live in the
present, so we have local information that can falsify many news stories. We do not live
in the past, so all we know is that we may be wildly oﬀ-base in our understanding of
history. There are no people from the past around to give ﬁrst hand accounts...though
we can read their books and sometimes watch their ﬁlms.
Here are some quick links that may surprise you about the past.2.6. IF THE NEWS IS FAKE, IMAGINE HISTORY 87
•In 1958, President Nasser of Egypt laughed at the idea that Egyptian women
would ever be forced to wear the hijab. Surprise: the Muslim world was far more
secular within living memory.
•After World War 2, Operation Paperclip put reformed German scientists to work
on the American space program. Surprise: the real Hidden Figures were Nazis.
•Germany sent Vladimir Lenin into Russia, potentially as part of a strategy to
destabilize their then-rival in war. Antony Sutton’s books document how some
Wall Street bankers apparently funded the Russian Revolution (and how other
Wall Street bankers funded the Nazis years later). Leon Trotsky spent time in
New York prior to the revolution, and propagandistic reporting from Americans
like John Reed aided Lenin and Trotsky in their revolution. Indeed, Reed was so
usefultotheSoviets—andsomisleadingastothenatureoftherevolution—that
he was buried at the base of the Kremlin Wall. Surprise: the Russian Revolution
wasn’t done wholly by Russians, but had signiﬁcant foreign involvement from
Germans and Americans.
•The Ochs-Sulzberger family, which owns The New York Times Company, owned
slaves but didn’t report that fact in their 1619 coverage.
•New York Times correspondent Walter Duranty won a Pulitzer Prize for help-
ing the Soviet Union starve Ukraine into submission, 90 years before the Times
decided to instead “stand with Ukraine.”
•Herbert Matthews, also a New York Times correspondent, helped Castro win
power in Cuba, leading to the murderous Cuban revolution and the subsequent
Cuban missile crisis that almost resulted in nuclear war.
•Another American “journalist,” Edgar Snow, wrote books such as Red Star Over
Chinathat praised Chairman Mao to the heavens before, during, and after Mao
embarked on programs of mass murder and collectivization.
•President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, architect of the US administrative state,

•The American architect of Bretton Woods, the IMF, and the World Bank, Harry
Dexter White, spied for the Soviets. He was one of dozens, according to the
Venona decrypts, declassiﬁed after the end of the Cold War.
•Henry Wallace, vice president of the United States during Roosevelt’s term in
1940, toured the Soviet gulag of Magadan and pronounced it ﬁne and dandy,
right before he just barely lost the VP nomination for 1944 to Harry Truman —
who then became president in 1945.
•The “liberating” Soviet Red Army raped its way across Eastern Europe in the
1940s, the same communists that The Times extolled as giving women a “better
sex life” in its 2017 anniversary series on the Russian Revolution.88 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
•The NYT’s Otto Tolischus reported Poland invaded Germany in 1939, reversing
the direction of the Nazi assault.
•Seymour Hersh details in The Dark Side of Camelot how John F. Kennedy’s men
in Illinois helped rig the 1960 election, an unmentioned scandal a full decade
before Watergate.
And that’s justthe 20th century, with a focus on the Cold War!
Once you start seeing that many dissonant facts, plenty of them from the same or-
ganizations like The New York Times Company that call themselves the “paper of
record” and the “ﬁrst draft of history,” that literally run billboards calling themselves
the “Truth”...you start to realize that there is an unreliable narrator problem.
What if Sulzberger is more like Keyser Söze? What if his employees are highly self-
interested professional prevaricators? What if they’ve always been like that? What
if you can’t trust anything they say, and by extension anything the US establishment
says, without checking it yourself?
As the Cold War ended, and the internet rose in the late 1990s, a spate of movies
came out — The Matrix ,Memento ,The Truman Show ,Fight Club ,The Game ,Men in
Black,The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind –— all about a constructed reality
where our memories aren’t real. It’s almost as if with the rise of the Network, that
there was a dim realization in the collective subconscious that everyone had been lied
to, deceived, anesthetized, sedated by the centralized States of the 20th century — not
just by the fascists and the communists, but the democratic capitalists too.
Just like someone who grew up in China and migrated to the US in adulthood would
ﬁnd that they’d have been lied to — that Mao wasn’t really “7 parts good and 3 parts
bad,” but far worse than that — those who grew up in the US and migrated to the
Internet in adulthood are starting to realize that something is up.
The reason is that the American establishment didn’t really understand what the inter-
net would mean for them. Because during the 20th century they’d made obvious-but-
threateningtruths, liketheexistenceofSovietspiesintheUS,rudetotalkabout. Then
a progression happened: after the obvious became rude, the rude became unsayable,
the unsayable became unthinkable, and the unthinkable went unthought. And once it
went unthought, it was no longer even thought about as a potential threat. Moreover,
the original people who’d consciously suppressed that obvious-but-threatening truth
had passed away.
So these unthought ideas were then sitting there waiting in a dusty tome, waiting
for someone to happen upon them, and accidentally rediscover them and put them
on the internet. Whether Google Books or Wikileaks or the Soviet archives or the
censorship-resistant web, there are now too many secrets in plain view.2.6. IF THE NEWS IS FAKE, IMAGINE HISTORY 89
The question now is whether a newly awakened US establishment can use its control
of chokepoints like Google and its various “fact-checkers” to suppress access to these
inconvenient truths, or whether web3-mediated services will make it permanently dif-
ﬁcult for the State to suppress the Network. You as the reader may have some input
on that.",1914
56,"2.6.3 Jurassic Ballpark
As a not-so-side note, in addition to falsiﬁed newspapers and history textbooks, your
distorted impression of the past — your Gell-Mann America — likely comes from
movies, to a greater extent than you might think. If you haven’t studied something in
depth, yourmentalmodelofitoftenimplicitlyreducestoafewscenesfromaHollywood
movie.
Let’s call this phenomenon “Jurassic Ballpark.” If you recall the scene from Jurassic
Parkwhere they splice in amphibian DNA to spackle over the gaps in their genetic
reconstruction, that’s similar to what media consumption has done to your brain.
You’re unconsciously splicing movie scenes into real-life as a ballpark approximation.
The gaps in your knowledge have been ﬁlled in by TV and movies. These are unreliable
narrators. For example:
•What’s your image of the US military? Often something from Top Gun orTrans-
formers. Even the negative portrayals depict it as all-powerful.
•What’s it like to run a business? The evil CEO is a TV trope. Countless sto-
ries cast a corporation with limitless resourcesas the main bad guy, from the
Terminator franchise to Lost.
•Who’s going to save us from the virus? Why, the competent public servants at
the CDC, as portrayed in Contagion .
By contrast, you very rarely see depictions of journalists, activists, professors, regula-
tors, and the like as bad guys. The public lacks televised narratives for how people in
those roles can go wrong. That’s why the behavior of journalists in real life was such
a surprise to Paul Graham:
One of the biggest surprises of my adult life is how unethical reporters are.
In movies they’re always the good guys.
“In movies they’re always the good guys.” Indeed! If you think about it, superheros
are literally portrayed as journalists (that’s the day job of both Clark Kent andPeter90 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Parker), and journalists are likewise portrayed as superheros (see movies like Spotlight
andThe Post ). The Intrepid Reporter is as much of a stock character as the Evil
Corporation.You don’t hear much about the evil reporter, though. You don’t hear
much about the evil communist, either.
Why? More than 20 years ago, Reason Magazine ran a story that still holds up well
today, called Hollywood’s Missing Movies , about how the ﬁlm industry airbrushed the
drama of the Cold War out of the 20th century. So it’s not just that the movie industry
ranpositiveportrayalsofUSestablishmentjournalists, theyalsoranpositiveportrayals
of out-and-out communists - but I repeat myself.
There are exceptions. Once in a while you do see a House of Cards that depicts evil
nonproﬁts, Democrats, and journalists. Once in a while you do get a Dallas Buyers
CluborGhostbusters that depicts evil regulators from the FDA or EPA. And more
recently you’ve started to see a few movies that even depict evil communists, not in
theinterchangeablecartoonvillainsenseofaRockyIV,butintheideologicalsense-the
Lives of Others ,The Way Back ,Bridge of Spies , and the Death of Stalin respectively
depict the spying, gulaging, imprisoning, murdering Communist states for what they
really were.
Still, these are very much exceptions. AI video analysis could quantify this, but if you
took the top N most popular movies and TV shows over the past several decades, in
terms of raw hours of footage watched, I’d bet the world has seen a >1000:1 ratio of
scenes featuring evil capitalists to scenes featuring evil communists.
Of course, these are ﬁctional stories, but as Graham’s quote illustrates, they serve as
real world archetypes. Even the FDA knows what a Tricorder is, and they think of it
as “good” only because it was portrayed as good in Star Trek. But most of the time
biomedical innovators are portrayed as evil, with all the attendant consequences. False
histories shape our reality. We all live in Jurassic Ballpark.",979

New countries begin with new stories.
Once we’ve dislodged the “arc of history” from our heads, that thing we didn’t even
know was there, the story that told us of the US establishment’s inevitability and
institutionalgoodness...oncewe’verealizedjusthowsimilarthatstoryistotheUSSR’s
similar narrative of inevitability and institutional goodness...once we’ve realized we
can’t count on the US establishment to be the “leader of the free world” or even to
successfully manage its domestic aﬀairs anymore...what’s left?
We’re going to need new stories. Movies where the big decision doesn’t end up on the
USpresident’sdesk, wheretheUSmilitaryisn’tcountedontosaveusfromaliens. News
feeds that don’t put American events by default on the frontpage. Supply chains and
digital services that don’t rely on an increasingly unpredictable and anarchic America.
Stories that decenter the US, in other words, but that still give the world hope.
That movie point is a disorienting one, isn’t it? You might be tempted to say it’s not
important. But it’s all-important. We don’t tell ﬁctional stories about the Kazakhstani
military saving the world because it wouldn’t be realistic. And after 2021, it isn’t
realistic to make stories about the US establishment saving the world either.
For example, a movie like 2011’s Contagion that depicts a competent CDC is now just
too far away from reality to permit suspension of disbelief. So instead we get a movie
like 2021’s Don’t Look Up , which depicts a chaotic America that’s still somehow the
center of events, still the country which the world relies on, but whose internal chaos
causes it to fall short. The next movie in that imaginary trilogy will probably not
center America. What could it center instead?94 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Unfortunately, the default right now would be to center China. The Chinese are after
all putting out blockbuster movies like Wolf Warrior 2 andBattle of Lake Changjin
wheretheybeat the Americans, save the world, and end up as number one. They have
that civilizational conﬁdence. And these movies are not laughable like they would have
been even a decade ago. China is a real contender for the crown, unlike Chad or Chile.
So that’s the set of stories that is waiting in the wings.
One response is to deny this and double down on American nostalgia, rolling out Top
Gun: Maverick and electing people born in the 1940s forever. This is what the US
establishment is currently doing, hanging on for dear life to the postwar order, denying
that any change is underway — and thereby refusing to gracefully adapt.
AnotherresponseistocomeupwithnewstoriesthatcenterneitherChinanorAmerica,
but that do center certain universal values - and that give a bridge between America
and what comes next, as America itself was a bridge between the British Empire and
the post-WW2 world.
We give four concrete examples in this chapter. But to be clear, just because a story
decenters America doesn’t mean it has to be punitive. That is, these stories don’t
have to condemn the US, anymore than the postwar order of 1945-1991 put the UK
in the dock, or the 1991-2021 order really beat up on the Soviets that much. Indeed,
a new story could well feature past aspects of the US in laudatory ways. The main
commonality is that we need new stories that no longer assume the US establishment
will continue to be at the center of the world, or else people will be psychologically
unprepared for that eventuality.
Another way of thinking about it is that the right kind of new story turns constants
into variables. Just as Bitcoin turned the constant of the US dollar into a variable, we
need new stories that turn the constant of the US establishment into a variable. By
decentering the US establishment in our mental models, we enable decentralization.
We envision a world where the US may not be there for us, because it was not always
there in the past, and may not endure far into the future.
Here are four such stories. The ﬁrst is the tale of the fragmentation of the postwar
consensus. The second is a generalization of Fredrick Jackson Turner’s frontier thesis.
The third recapitulates the Fourth Turning concept from Strauss and Howe, as well as
Turchin and Dalio’s work, all of which predict signiﬁcant conﬂict to come in the West.
The fourth talks about how our future is our past, how the mid-20th century is like a
funhouse mirror moment, and how we are now seeing a bizarre phenomenon where we
repeat past events but get opposite outcomes.
All of them turn constants into variables, as they describe a pre-American era where
the US didn’t yet exist, and thereby prepare us for a post-American period where the
US in its current form no longer exists.2.7. FRAGMENTATION, FRONTIER, FOURTH TURNING, FUTURE IS OUR PAST 95",1205
59,"2.7.1 The Fragmentation Thesis
The Sovereign Individual , written in 1999, is an incredible book that nailed many as-
pects of our digital future decades in advance, Bitcoin prime among them. We won’t
recapitulate the whole thing here, but in short the thesis is that after many genera-
tions in which technology favored centralization (railroads, telegraph, radio, television,
movies, mass production) since about 1950 it is now favoring decentralization (transis-
tor, personal computer, internet, remote work, smartphone, cryptocurrency).
So by this measure, peak centralization was about 1950, when there was one
telephone company (AT&T), two superpowers (US/USSR), and three TV stations
(ABC/CBS/NBC). Even though the 1950s are romanticized in the US, and there were
certainly good things about the era, that level of centralization was not natural. This
was an enormous degree of cultural homogenization, conformity, and sameness relative
to the pre-1914 world just a few decades prior. Many aspects of individual initiative,
creativity, and freedom had been dulled down or eliminated in the standardization
process.
Read William H. Whyte’s The Organization Man or James Burnham’s Managerial
Revolution for a portrait of this midcentury time period. At the time, the mid-century
US was more corporatist than entrepreneurial. Yes, the system was capitalism, but
a highly managed and regulated sort of capitalism. It was all about joining the big
company and working your way up, not founding one, except for the rare and just be-
ginning startup phenomenon on the West Coast, which was a million-fold less common
than it is now.
Everything was signiﬁcantly to the economic left and social right of where it is today.
Yes, the USA wasn’t communist, but it did have 90% top marginal tax rates, to stop
any new people from getting rich and potentially threatening the system FDR built.
Similarly, the USSR was far more socially conservative than is commonly remembered,
doing things like taxing childless women to reduce their status if they didn’t reproduce.
Typically, those who complain about ﬁlter bubbles are actually complaining that there
is more than one. Namely, they are annoyed that all information doesn’t derive from
establishment sources only. That situation actually did obtain in the mid-century US,
when tens of millions of Americans all assembled in their living rooms at the same time
to watch I Love Lucy .
Then it all decentralized, fragmented. The story is told in essays like Paul Graham’s
“Refragmentation,” and in The Sovereign Individual . And we call this the Fragmenta-
tion thesis.",608
60,"2.7.2 The Frontier Thesis
In the late 1800s, Fredrick Jackson Turner gave an inﬂuential talk on the concept of
the frontier as the crucial driving force in American history. At that time, it was
understood that the free land of the frontier was crucial to the US in several ways - as96 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
a way for the ambitious to seek their fortunes, as a national aspiration in the form of
Manifest Destiny, as bare land for social experiments.
Today, of course, the concept of the frontier and Manifest Destiny is not only not
admired, but has been pathologized since the 60s by the same deconstructionism that
is one half of wokeness. You know the story: the American frontiersmen, like Columbus
before them, were racists, colonialists, and imperalists.
But two points on this before we proceed.
The ﬁrst is that there were Ntribes ﬁghting in the Americas before the arrival of the
Spanish, the British, and the like. The Europeans simply represented tribes N+ 1,
N+2, and so on. Had one of the Native American tribes developed a technological edge
overanyoftheEuropeantribes, hadtheyinventedoceanicnavigation, theywouldlikely
have invaded Europe. We can infer this because (a) when the Mongols had a similar
technological edge they did invade Europe and (b) many North American tribes were
by contemporaneous accounts people accustomed to war. So, it’s old-fashioned, but it’s
probably healthier to think of the Native Americans more like the 300 Spartans than
as helpless victims — brave warriors who fought valiantly but lost to superior forces.
The second is that if you read books like Reich’s Who We Are and How We Got Here , it
makes clear that history is a boneyard. Contra the opening notes of Microsoft’s recent
Ignite conference, there’s probably not a single ethnic group on the planet that simply
peacefully occupied their plot of land since “time immemorial.” One tribe’s homeland
was once their distant ancestors’ frontier.
So, with that as preface, let’s generalize the frontier thesis. One way of thinking about
it is that the frontier actually opened in 1492, well before the founding of the Americas.
What’s little known is that Columbus’ voyage to the New World was in part driven
by the Ottoman blockade of the Eastern Mediterranean; it was an attempt to ﬁnd an
alternative path to India around the Ottomans, but it ended up using technology to
reopen the frontier in the face of political roadblocks.
From 1492 to 1890, Europeans had what they considered a frontier. It started with
transatlantic navigation and the discovery of the New World, then proceeded to Euro-
pean colonialism, and from there to the independence of the US and Western expansion
via Manifest Destiny. Towards the end of this period, authors like Charles Nordhoﬀ
inCommunistic Societies of the United States noted how important the frontier was,
how bad it would be if that avenue for ambitious men was closed oﬀ, and how nasty
the Trade-Unionists were getting.
Hitherto, in the United States, our cheap and fertile lands have acted as
an important safety-valve for the enterprise and discontent of our non-
capitalist population. Every hired workman knows that if he chooses to use
economy and industry in his calling, he may without great or insurmount-
able diﬃculty establish himself in independence on the public lands; and,2.7. FRAGMENTATION, FRONTIER, FOURTH TURNING, FUTURE IS OUR PAST 97
in fact, a large proportion of our most energetic and intelligent mechanics
do constantly seek these lands...
I do not doubt that the eagerness of some of our wisest public men for
the acquisition of new territory has arisen from their conviction that this
opening for the independence of laboring men was essential to the security
of our future as a free and peaceful state...
Any circumstance, as the exhaustion of these lands, which should materi-
ally impair this opportunity for independence, would be, I believe, a serious
calamity to our country; and the spirit of the Trades-Unions and Interna-
tional Societies appears to me peculiarly mischievous and hateful, because
they seek to eliminate from the thoughts of their adherents the hope or
expectation of independence. The member of a Trades-Union is taught to
regard himself, and to act toward society, as a hireling for life; and these
societies are united, not as men seeking a way to exchange dependence for
independence, but as hirelings, determined to remain such, and only de-
manding better conditions of their masters. If it were possible to infuse
with this spirit all or the greater part of the non-capitalist class in the
United States, this would, I believe, be one of the gravest calamities which
could befall us as a nation; for it would degrade the mass of our voters,
and make free government here very diﬃcult, if it did not entirely change
the form of our government, and expose us to lasting disorders and attacks
upon property.
Nordhoﬀ was right. The aggression of the Trade-Unions eventually led to the commu-
nist revolutions which killed tens of millions of people globally, led to “lasting disorders
and attacks upon property”, and generally became the bane of the world.
We can attribute some of this to the pause, to the closing of the frontier in 1890.
That closing took away paths for ambitious men, and ensured that they couldn’t easily
become founders on their own plot of land - they had to become union organizers, or
revolutionaries, or demagogues of some kind. Without the frontier, it all became zero
sum. And thus we entered the steel cage match of the 20th century between fascism,
communism, and democratic capitalism. There were some important frontier-related
technological developments during this period in space shuttles (and cruise ships!), but
the frontier itself was not open.
Humanity managed to survive through a bloody 20th century. After 1991, the frontier
reopened as commerce on the internet was legalized. By the late 2010s, the combination
of centralization and wokiﬁcation (in the West) and Xi-iﬁcation (in China) threatened
to close this frontier too, but BTC and web3 and the open metaverse have given the
digital frontier a new lease on life.
Today, if we assess where we’re at, there are four possibilities for the frontier: the land,
the internet, the sea, and space. Right now, there are 7.7B people on land, 3.2B on
the internet, about 2-3M on the high seas, and less than 10 currently in space.98 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
So, practically speaking, an “internet frontier” is easier than the other three. If we’re
lucky, we’ll be able to use the concepts from the network state to reopen the physical
frontier, through a hybrid internet/land strategy, as described in this book.
To summarize, (a) the period of European greatness corresponded to the open frontier
from 1492-1890, (b) the period of total war corresponded to the closing frontier from
1890-1991 which ushered in a necessarily zero-sum world, (c) the peaceful reopening
of the digital frontier could lead us again to a time of greatness, (d) the American and
Chinese establishments are trying to close that frontier and trap us into the same steel
cage match of the 20th century, (e) but with suﬃciently good technology we might be
able to escape these political roadblocks and (f) reopen not just a digital frontier, but
a physical one: on remote pieces of land, on the sea, and eventually in space. This is
what we refer to as the generalized Frontier thesis.",1799
61,"2.7.3 The Fourth Turning Thesis
The Fourth Turning andAges of Discord both predict very signiﬁcant unrest within
the US in the coming years. Ray Dalio does as well in Principles for Dealing with
the Changing World Order , though he conﬁnes most of his comments to monetary
apocalypse. Their models are somewhat related.
The Fourth Turning came out in 1997 and is based on a quasi-cyclical theory of Anglo-
American history, where conﬂict erupts roughly every 75 years. If you believe in these
patterns and want a possible underlying driver of them, 75 years is about one long
human lifespan. So perhaps those who do not rememberhistory really aredoomed
to repeat it.
Turchin’s predictions came out around 2008 in a Nature article, and he’s written them
up at length in War and Peace and War . He has impressive timestamped graphs
with speciﬁc forecasts as to why conﬂict will rise, using various measures for societal
instability like elite overproduction and the wage share of the masses.
Dalio’s thesis is that we’re about to experience events that have never happened before
in our lives, but have happened many times before in history. He goes back further than
the Fourth Turning to the British and Dutch empires, and has some quasi-quantitative
analysis to support his view.

this the Fourth Turning Thesis.2.7. FRAGMENTATION, FRONTIER, FOURTH TURNING, FUTURE IS OUR PAST 99",404

Take a look at this video of unmixing a ﬂuid. Isn’t that bizarre? You can see the
same process going backward in time, in an unexpected way. This is not the kind of
trajectory we expect to see, but it happens under certain conditions.
And it’s one model for what’s happening in the world, as we redecentralize after a
century of centralization. In other words, an important consequence of the fragmen-
tation thesis is that our future may be more like our past. If peak centralization was
around 1950, with one telephone company (AT&T) and two superpowers (US, USSR)
and three television stations (ABC, CBS, NBC), we grow moredecentralized as we
move ineitherdirection from that point.
Essentially, the invention of the transistor in 1947 is like a mirror moment. And as you
go forward and backward in time you start to see events repeating, but as funhouse
mirror versions of themselves, often with the opposite outcome. Our future is our past .
Let’s go through some examples:
•Today, the internet frontier reopens; back then, the western frontier closed.
•Today, we experience COVID-19; back then we experienced the Spanish Flu.
•Today, we have tech billionaires; back then we had the captains of industry.
•Today, founders like Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey seem to be winning against
establishment journalists; back then, the likes of Ida Tarbell demagogued and
defeated Rockefeller.
•Today, we have cryptocurrencies; back then we witnessed the era of private bank-
ing.
•Today, we have a populist movement of digital gold advocates; back then, we had
a populist movement againstgold in the form of the Cross of Gold speech.
•Today, we have the inﬂation and cultural conﬂict of Weimar America; back then,
we had the inﬂation and cultural conﬂict of Weimar Germany.
•Today, in Weimar America, we have right and left ﬁghting in the streets; back
then, in Weimar Germany, we had left and right ﬁghting in the streets.
•Today, the capitalists successfully teamed up with the generals against a sitting
president; back then, the generals sided with the sitting president against the
capitalists.
•Today, we have what Turchin considers antebellum-like polarization; back then,
we had what we now know to be antebellum polarization.
•Today, we have Airbnb; back then, we had ﬂophouses.
•Today, we have Uber; back then, we had gypsy cabs.100 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
•Today, The New York Times sides with Ukraine to ﬁght nationalist Russia; back
then, The New York Times sided with communist Russia to starve out Ukraine.
•Today, we see the transition from “neutral” to yellow journalism; back then, we
saw the transition from yellow to “neutral” journalism.
•Today, ﬁgures like Mike Moritz think of China as energetic and America as la-
conic, but back then folks like Bertrand Russell thought of America as energetic
and China as laconic.
We can think of more examples, with respect to the emerging Second Cold War.
•Today, we’re seeing the Chinese and Russians again line up against the West,
except this time, the Chinese are the senior partner in the relationship.
•Today, we may see a third group arise outside of the Cold War axis, except this
time rather than being the “Third World” and non-aligned, it may be “Web3” and
economically aligned.
•And today, depending on how the economics play out, that third faction may
come in ﬁrst, the Second World may come in second, and the former First World
may end up last.
And if we go back further in time:
•Today, we see a US that’s gradually federalizing into individual states and an
Indian state that’s uniﬁed many subcontinental ethnic groups. Back in the late
1940s, we saw an India that was gradually centralizing away from individual
princely states, and a United States that uniﬁed many European ethnicities.
•Today, we’re seeing so-far unsuccessful calls for wealth seizures in the US; back
then, we saw Executive Order 6102, the successful seizure of gold.
•Today, we’re seeing the rise of the pseudonymous founder and startup societies;
back then, in the 1770s, we saw pseudonymous founders of startup countries.
•Today, we’re seeing the re-encryption of the map; further back in time, before
1492, maps had terra incognita .
Thecarefulobserverwillnote thattheseevents aren’tallhappeningin exactly thesame
reverse order. It’s not A/B/C/D and then D/C/B/A like a melody. Moreover, the ﬁrst
set of events is more spaced out over time, while the second is highly clumped together,
with internet-era events years, rather than decades, apart. Finally, the repetition of
each event is often not exactly the same as the previous, but often a “version 3.0.” For
example, Bitcoin is not simply the sameas gold, but a version 3.0 that combines some
aspects of gold and some aspects of digitized ﬁat currencies.
Still, there seems to be something going on. What’s the unifying theory here?
One model, as just discussed in the Fragmentation Thesis, is that technology favored
centralization in the West and especially the US from arguably 1754-1947 ( Join, or Die2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 101
in the French and Indian War, uniﬁed national government post-Civil War, railroads,
telegraph, radio, television, movies, mass media in general, and mass production).
And technology is now favoring decentralization from roughly 1950 to the present day
(transistor, personal computer, internet, remote work, smartphone, cryptocurrency).
So, in the West, the grip of the centralized state has begun to slacken. The East is
a diﬀerent matter; after a century of communism, socialism, civil war, and Partition,
China and India are more internally uniﬁed than they’ve been in a long time.
Before we immediately jump to thinking that world is ending, though, we should note
that during the riseof Western centralized power people (understandably) complained
about centralized power and homogeneity, just as today during the fallof Western
centralized power they are complaining about fragmentation and lack of common voice.
That doesn’t mean we’ve come full circle, exactly. As per the helical theory of history,
we might have progressed orregressed. But there may be an underlying cycle: “the
empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.”
Anyway, this model would explain why we’re seeing an inversion: there was an upward
arc that favored the centralized State, but now we’re in the middle of a downward arc
that favors the decentralized Network.So various historical events are recurring with
the opposite results, like the ﬂuid ﬂowing in reverse. And that’s the thesis on how our
Future is Our Past.",1699
63,"2.8 Left is the New Right is the New Left
Marx’s concept of a class struggle has been so inﬂuential that people don’t realize that
sometimes those revolutionary classes won, and became ruling classes. And then in
turn fought the subsequent revolutionary classes.
In fact, they often did.
Understanding this is important if you want to build a startup society. Unless you
are signiﬁcantly diﬀerentiated from the establishment — unless you have a “10X value
proposition”, as a venture capitalist would put it — you’re not going to attract citizens.
Social diﬀerentiation means being revolutionary in some sense. Not necessarily in the
sense of the Paris Commune. But morally revolutionary in the sense of inverting some
premise that society at large thinks is good, yet that you can show — through your
meticulous study of history — is actually bad.That moral inversion is the moral
innovation that’s the basis for a startup society, and it leads us ineluctably to left-vs-
right.102 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY",253
64,"2.8.1 Why Discuss Left and Right at All?
Wait. Can’twejustdotechnologywithoutpolitics,orusetechnologytoescapepolitics?
Unfortunately, no, because politics is about people who disagree with you. If you’re
working with computers, or robots, or pure math, you don’t have politics. If you’re
in a highly aligned society, you don’t have politics either. But to buildsuch a highly
aligned society from scratch, you need to think about politics.
Put another way, if the startup founders of the 2000s and 2010s had to level up beyond
technology to learn business, the startup society founders of the 2020s need to add
history and politics to their curriculum. Because a theory of left and right is necessary
for nation formation.
Our theory begins by discussing the split between visions of moral and technological
progress, the analogy between political and ﬁnancial arbitrage, the market for revolu-
tionaries of both the political activist and tech founder type, and the concept of startup
societies as a way to reunify moral and technological progress.
Next we discuss left and right as real constructs, using the spatial theory of voting to
obviate the objection that left and right don’t really exist, and qualifying our observa-
tion by noting these are point-in-time constructs.
Subsequently we discuss how left and right change over time, using examples from
what we call the left, right, and libertarian cycles, in the context of both State-oriented
political movements and more recent Network-centric tech startups.
Finally, we discuss several speciﬁc “ﬂippenings” through history where winning teams
changed ideological orientation upon victory, and give a thesis on what the next ﬂip-
pening will look like.",399
65,"2.8.2 Reunifying Technological and Moral Progress
Before we get into left-vs-right, the concept of starting a new project with a moral
rather than technological innovation will be unfamiliar to many tech founders. So let’s
make it familiar.
First, we need to understand the surprising similarities between startup founders and
political activists, between those focused on technological innovation and those inter-
ested in moral good. The turn-of-the-century progressives thought of these as the same
thing: progress was both technological and moral progress. Public sanitation, for ex-
ample, was both a technological innovation and a moral good (“cleanliness was next to
godliness”).
More recently, technological and moral innovators have grown to be at odds, because
the US establishment now regards its economic disruptors as enemies.As we’ll get
to, the idea of funding presidents of startup societies around the world could reunify
technological and moral progress. But what exactly do we mean by “moral progress”?2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 103
Moral Progress is Moral Innovation is Moral Inversion
If you want to produce moral and not just technological progress, you’re going to
have to introduce new moral premises that invert what people previously believed. So
one man’s moral innovation is another man’s moral inversion. Here are some speciﬁc
examples:
•smoking was acceptable, is now considered “bad”
•alcohol was “bad” during Prohibition, is now acceptable
•proﬁt was “bad” under Communism, is now acceptable
•college was once considered merely acceptable, but in the postwar era became
“good”
Some observations immediately come to mind.
1. First, from this list, you should be able to generate many more examples (we
avoided the very obvious ones). And you might realize that a signiﬁcant fraction
of today’s public conversation is devoted to debating whether X is morally good
or bad, usually without stating it quite so bluntly.
2. Second, a moral innovation need not ﬂip something all the way from “good” to
“bad”. Simply ﬂipping it from “bad” to “acceptable” or “acceptable” to “bad” can
be highly consequential.
3. Third, we can see that moral progress is not as straightforward as technological
progress. The moral step forward that Communism proposed - the premise that
“proﬁt was bad” - was actually a terrible innovation that led to tens of millions
dead and a worse-oﬀ world. By contrast, the Enlightenment’s moral innovations
were good, at least in the sense that they led to technological development.
4. Fourth, that last point shows that benchmarking what “moral good” means is
nontrivial. Does it mean deontologically good, or consequentially good? That
is, is this moral principle good in some abstract sense, or is it good because it
produces measurably good results?
5. Fifth, if a given society has its moral foundations generally right, then most of
the proposed moral innovations or inversions will actually make people worse oﬀ
if imposed on the populace at large.
All of this is true. Nevertheless, a key realization for a tech founder should be that a
signiﬁcant fraction of people wantmoral progress. Just as much as the technologist
wants to get to Mars, a large chunk of society wants to feel like the good guys ﬁghting
in some grand cause. And if you don’t give them that cause, they’ll make one up,
and/or start ﬁghting each other. (Note that Mars is itself a moral cause when framed
in terms of “backing up humanity” or “exploring the ﬁnal frontier”.)104 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Another realization is that consent can bound the scope of moral innovation. The
communistrevolutionsofthe20thcenturywereevilnotjustbecauseoftheirmurderous
results, but because they ran a giant human experiment on people against their will.
Those who wanted to opt out, to exit, were stopped by Berlin Walls and Iron Curtains.
But the forgotten American “communistic societies” of the 1800s were generally good,
because only those who wanted to be there remained. Anyone who didn’t like it could
leave. That’swhythereopeningofthefrontierissoimportant: itgivesspacetomorally
innovate without aﬀecting those who don’t consent to the experiment.
A third realization is that technological innovation drives moral innovation. While
human nature may be roughly constant, technology is not. So new tech causes the
introduction of new moral principles, or the re-evaluation of old ones. Consider the
premise that “freedom of speech is good”: that means one thing in 1776, another
thing during the era of highly centralized mass media, and yet another in an era when
everything reduces to speech-like digital symbols transmitted over the internet.
A related realization is that moral innovation drives technological innovation. Once it
was no longer considered morally “evil” to propose a heliocentric model, people could
develop more accurate star charts, which in the fullness of time got us to oceanic
navigation, satellites, and space travel. Conversely, if you introduce the moral premise
that “digital centralization is bad”, you move down the branch of the tech tree that
begins with Bitcoin.
A ﬁnal realization is that just like most attempts at technological innovation fail, most
attempts at moral innovation will also fail. However, if those failures occur within the
boundedconﬁnesofaconsensualstartupsociety, they’remoreacceptableasthepriceof
moral progress. And if you think society has in many ways now generally become bad,
it may not that be that hard to ﬁnd ways to improve on it through a moral inversion.
Political Arbitrage and Financial Arbitrage
A moral inversion is a form of political arbitrage. Nietzsche criticized it when Chris-
tianity did it, but also had to admit it worked.Why did it work? One view is that
“aﬄict the comfortable and comfort the aﬄicted” is essentially the same concept as
buy low/sell high. You’re supporting something when it’s low and shorting it when it’s
high.
The mood of the words is very diﬀerent, of course. The political arbitrage of supporting
those with low status and attacking those with high status is typically framed as a
moral imperative, while the ﬁnancial arbitrage of buying assets with low value and2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 105
sellingassetsofhighvalueisusuallyportrayedasadispassionatemechanismforgaining
ﬁnancialcapital. Butrecallthatpeople dosometimesmakemoralargumentsforbuying
low and selling high (“it helps markets become more eﬃcient”). So you might invert
the mood of the words on the other side too, and think of “aﬄicting the comfortable
and comforting the aﬄicted” as a dispassionate mechanism for gaining political capital .
There’s a related observation: the concept of “buy low, sell high” assumes there are
many diﬀerent assets to choose from, many axes to arbitrage. By contrast, the concept
of “aﬄict the comfortable and comfort the aﬄicted” tacitly assumes only oneaxis of
powerful-vs-weak. However, multiple axes of power exist. For example, a man who
organizes a million dollars for charity may be economically comfortable, yet can be
socially weak relative to the establishment journalist who decides to aﬄict him for
his tweets. So the ability to designate just who exactly is “comfortable” and who is
“aﬄicted” isitselfaformofpower. Someonewhocanpickwhotolabelas“comfortable”,
who can pick the axis of political arbitrage, can keep knocking down the “comfortable”
while themselves remaining very comfortable. And that means the concept of “aﬄicting
the comfortable and comforting the aﬄicted” can also be a mechanism for maintaining
political capital .
Putting these ideas together, once you start reclassifying much of the moral language
ﬂying through the air as a kind of political arbitrage, you can start thinking about it
more rationally. Political arbitrage involves backing a faction that is politically weaker",1985
66,"today than it could or should be. An early backer that risks their own political capital
to make a faction more justly powerful can also gain a slice of that power should it
actually materialize.
Think about the status that accrued to the Founding Fathers, to the early Bolshe-
viks, to Mao’s victorious communists, to the civil rights activists, or to the Eastern
European dissidents after the Soviets fell. These very diﬀerent groups of social revolu-
tionaries all took signiﬁcant status risks — and gained signiﬁcant status rewards come
the revolution.
The Market for Revolutionaries
Once we see the mapping between ﬁnancial and political arbitrage, we realize there is
a market for revolutionaries.
Today, therearetwokindsofrevolutionaries: technologicalandpolitical. Andthereare
two kinds of backers of these revolutionaries: venture capitalists and philanthropists.
The backers seek out the founders, the ambitious leaders of new technology companies
and new political movements. And that is the market for revolutionaries.
Equipped with this framework, you can map the tech ecosystem to the political ecosys-
tem. You can analogize tech founders to political activists, venture capitalists to polit-
ical philanthropists, tech trends to social movements, YC Startup School to the Oslo
Freedom Forum, the High Growth Handbook toBeautiful Trouble , startups to NGOs,
big companies to government agencies, Crunchbase to CharityNavigator, and so on.106 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Just as there is an entire ecosystem to source and back tech founders, there is an entire
ecosystem to do so for political activists. It’s less explicit in key respects, of course.
There aren’t term sheets between political philanthropists and their young proteges,
there aren’t “exits” to the tune of billions of dollars, and we don’t usually see political
activists bragging about their funding in the same way that tech founders talk up
their investors. Indeed, often the funding trail is intentionally obscured, to frustrate
opposition research.
But the process of going from a revolutionary’s bright idea to a small group with a bit
of funding to a mass movement is similar to the journey of a tech startup. And the
endgame can be even more ambitious; if the top tech founders end up running compa-
nies like Google and Facebook, the top political activists end up running countries like
Myanmar and Hungary.It’s “going public” in a diﬀerent way.
Take another look at the careers of political activists as varied as Aung San Suu Kyi,
Viktor Orban, Vaclav Havel, Hamid Karzai, Ahmad Chalabi, Joshua Wong, Liu Xi-
aobo, and the like. All of them ﬁt this model. Western resources backed them to
come to power and build pro-Western governments in their region. That doesn’t mean
these political founders always won (Wong and Xiaobo very much did not) or executed
well (Karzai and Chalabi did not), or even stayed West-aligned indeﬁnitely (Suu Kyi
and Orban did not). But if you track each of their careers back, you’ll see something
like this episode, when Soros was funding Orban and both were on the same side as
revolutionary forces against the Soviets. At that point in time, Soros was the philan-
thropist and Orban his protege, much as a venture capitalist might back an ambitious
young founder. That’s a classic example of how backers seek leaders in the market for
revolutionaries.
Startup Societies Reunify Technological and Moral Progress
You might ﬁnd it surprising, or disquieting, to think about all these diﬀerent political
revolutions as being similar to VC-backed startups. But revolutions are diﬃcult to
bootstrap, so there’s often a great power sponsor. The French were crucial to the
American Revolution, for example.
What’s the relevance for us? Well, the startup society reuniﬁes the concepts of techno-
logical and political revolution, pulls together the two diﬀerent kinds of progress, and
presents a new path to power. Because now both the tech founder and the political
activist can declare themselves presidents of a startup society.
Backers can fund startup societies using the mechanisms of tech, out in the open, with2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 107
explicit contracts, and consent by all citizens. But they can also achieve the moral
innovation desired by the political revolutionaries. And if these startup societies are
built out on the frontier, whether digital or physical, then the moral innovations are
no longer imposed top-down, but adopted bottom-up by the people who opt in. That
gives a better way to achieve the goals of ambitious young political reformers.
In short, once we see that a tech founder builds a startup company to eﬀect economic
change, and a political activist builds a social movement to eﬀect moral change, we can
see how the startup societies we describe in this work combine aspects of both.",1153
67,"2.8.3 Two Ideologies
The Spatial Theory of Voting
Now we turn to left and right.
The simplest approach is to talk about the left and right as if they are permanent
categories; you’ll hear this when people talk about “the left” and “the right” as groups.
The second order approach is to contest this binary. People will (correctly!) note
that realignments happen, that the left/right dichotomization doesn’t fully encode
political behavior, that the masses aren’t as ideologically consistent as the elites, that
the categories vary over time, and so on.
The third order approach is to acknowledge this complexity but invoke the spatial
theory of voting, which allows us to quantify matters. As reviewed in this PDF, the
spatial theory of voting allows us to analyze everything from Congressional votes to
Supreme Court decisions to newspaper editorials. When we do so, the ﬁrst principal
component of political variation doesindeed correspond to the left/right spectrum.
The fourth order approach is to then note that this (real!) axis actually rotatesover
time. It’s more about relative tribal positioning (voting with members of the same
political tribe) than absolute ideological positioning (voting for a constant ideological
position). Revolutionary tactics eventually succeed in gaining power for one tribe, and
ruling class tactics eventually fail to defend power for another tribe, so the “left” and
“right” gradually switch over historical timescales even as the tribal names remain the
same.
Fights Create Factions
Two factions consistently arise because coalition-forming behavior is game-theoretically
optimal. That is, when ﬁghting over any scarceresource, if one group teams up and
the other doesn’t, the ﬁrst group tends to win.
This is a fundamental reason why humans tend to consolidate into two factions that
ﬁght each other over scarce resources till one wins. The winning team enjoys a brief108 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
honeymoon, after which it usually then breaks up internally into left and right factions
again, and the battle begins anew. After the French Revolution, factions famously
arose. After World War 2, the once-allied US and USSR went to Cold War. And
after the end of the Cold War, the victorious US faction broke down into internal
hyperpolarization. A strong leader might keep this from happening for a while, but the
breakdown of a victorious side into left and right factions is almost a law of societal
physics.
Left and Right as Temporary Tactics, Not Constant Classes
The names for the two tactics that arise in these battles may hail from the French
Revolution— the left and the right — but they’re almost like magnetic north and
south, like yin and yang, seemingly encoded into our nature.
The left tactic is to delegitimize the existing order, argue it is unjust, and angle for
redistributing the scarce resource (power, money, status, land), while the right tactic
is to argue that the current order is fair, that the left is causing chaos, and that the
ensuing conﬂict will destroy the scarce resource and not simply redistribute it.
You can think of circumstances where the right was correct, and those where the left
was. A key concept is that on a historical timescale, right and left are temporary tac-
tics as opposed to deﬁning characteristics of tribes. For example, Protestants originally
used left tactics relative to the Catholic Church in the time of Martin Luther. Then,
hundreds of years later, the American descendants of those revolutionaries - the Protes-
tant establishment, the WASPs – used right tactics to defend its position as the ruling
class. As we discuss, many such ﬂippenings occur in history, where a given tribe uses
leftist tactics in one historical period and its cultural descendants use rightist tactics
in another.
What’s the guideline for when a tribe will use left or right tactics? The tribe that’s
defending (the ruling class) uses right tactics, and the tribe that’s attacking (the rev-
olutionary class) uses left tactics. Because institutional defenders tend to win, each
individual member of a revolutionary class feels like they’re losing. But because insti-
tutional defenders have to constantly ﬁght swarms of revolutionaries to hold onto their
position, the ruling class also feels like it’s on the back foot.
While there are big victories where the tribe using right or left tactics manages to
sweep the ﬁeld of their enemies for a brief interval, a new tribe usually arises that is
to their respective left or right, and the battle begins anew. Can we ever escape this
cycle of conﬂict over scarce resources?2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 109
Frontiers Mitigate Factions
The key word there is scarce. Everything changes when the frontier opens up, when
there is a new realm of unoccupied space, where resources are suddenly less scarce.
There’s less obligate wrangling, because an aggrieved faction can choose ﬁght orﬂight,
voiceorexit. The would-be revolutionary doesn’t necessarily have to use left tactics to
overthrow the ruling class anymore, resulting in a right crackdown in response. They
can instead leave for the frontier if they don’t like the current order, to show that their
way is better, or alternatively fail as many startups do.
The frontier means the revolutionary is simultaneously less practically obstructed in
their path to reform (because the ruling class can’t stop them from leaving for the
frontier and taking unhappy citizens with them), but also more ethically constrained
(because the revolutionary can’t simply impose their desired reforms by ﬁat, and must
instead gain express consent by having people opt into their jurisdiction).
These are, however, reasonable tradeoﬀs. So while the frontier is not a panacea, it is at
least a pressure valve. That’s why reopening the frontier may be the most important
meta-political thing we can do to reduce political conﬂict.
Two Ghosts, Diﬀerent Hosts
We’ve talked about the left and right as tactics. You can also think of them as two
ghosts, with diﬀerent hosts. In any population, at any given time, one subpopulation
will be hosting the leftist ghost and the other will be animated by the rightist ghost.
Left and right in this sense are almost like spirits that ﬂit from host to host, occupying
the minds of millions of people at the same time, coordinating groups against each
other. And as you start looking at the history of religions or political movements, you
can start to see that each has a “left mode” for revolutionary oﬀense and a “right mode”
for ruling class defense.
Why then do people often discuss left and right as if they were permanent classes rather
than temporary tactics?
One answer comes from an analogy to tech startups. Just like a startup wants to
maintainthepretenseofbeing“revolutionary” foraslongaspossible,andabigcompany
wants to maintain the pretense of being “dominant” for as long as possible, so too does
it take a while for a revolutionary leftist to admit that they’ve becoming ruling class, or
for a self-conceptualized member of the ruling class to admit they’ve actually become
dispossessed. Paradoxically, bothsuch admissions are demoralizing. Obviously, for the
former member of the ruling class to concede that they’ve completely lost is a blow to
morale. But for the former revolutionary to recognize they’ve won likewise takes the
sails out of their movement, the moral justiﬁcation for their revolution.
Another reason is that the switching tends to happen gradually, over historical
timescales. So it’s not unreasonable to talk about “the left” or “the right” in a given
period. Today, though, we’re in a realigning time where the switching is more visible.110 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
My Left is Your Right
Note that we take no position on whether left or right strategies are objectively “good.”
In our model, these are just tactics used by warring tribes, by two diﬀerent social
networks going at it. The revolutionary tribe uses left tactics and the ruling tribe uses
right tactics. But if the tribe using leftist tactics starts winning, it starts using rightist
tactics to defend its wins, and vice versa.
As an analogy, take a look at this GIF of two magnets. They repel each other into
mirror positions. Think of this as an analogy for left and right: my left is your right.
Whatever you adopt, I’ll have to adopt the mirror tactic.",1990
68,"Americans saw this in fast-forward during COVID. First the Republicans were con-
cerned about the virus, and the Democrats were calling people racists for paying atten-
tion to it. Then once Trump started saying the virus wasn’t serious, positions ﬂipped,
with the Democrats calling for (and implementing) lockdowns and the Republicans
ﬁghting them on libertarian grounds. Then Trump ﬂipped again to supporting vac-
cines, while Biden, Harris, and other Democrats said they wouldn’t trust a rushed
Trump vaccine. Then the vaccine came out (the same one developed under the Trump
Administration’s Operation Warp Speed!) and many Democrats were suddenly all in
favor of mandating that which they once wanted to avoid, while many Republicans
now booed this as an intolerable infringement on liberty.
You can rationalize these twists and turns. Those who do so commonly invoke Keynes:
“When the facts change, I change my mind — what do you do, sir?” You might say that
the US was ﬁrst too apathetic towards COVID-19, and then it overreacted. Committed
partisans can no doubt give logical explanations for the observed sequence of events.
But forget about these details for a second and focus on the ﬂip-ﬂops. Whatever
position one group adopted, the other did the opposite. The parsimonious explanation
isthatitwasjustmagnetsrepelling, factionsﬁghting. Professedidealswerejustamask
for tribal interest. This ﬁts the model of left and right swapping over time, because
we’re now seeing those swaps happen in real-time. In such a period, the conﬂict is
more obviously tribal (“Democrat-vs-Republican”) than ideological (“left-vs-right”).
Putting it all together, we propose that (a) left and right are quantiﬁable phenomena
we can see via the spatial theory of voting, (b) the left/right axis is real but rotates
with time, (c) they’re ancient and ineradicable concepts, arguably on par with yin/yang
or magnetic north/south, (d) they’re complementary tactics to gain access to scarce
resources, (e) if one group uses a left tactic, the other is almost forced to adopt a
right tactic in response, and vice versa, (f) the frontier reduces political left/right
issues because it reduces conﬂict over scarce resources, (g) we can think of left as
revolutionary tactics and right as ruling class tactics and (h) the tactics constantly
swap hosts over historical timeframes.
Let’s now drill into that last point, perhaps the least obvious: namely the concept that
left and right change hosts over historical timeframes. Our study begins by introducing
the left, right, and libertarian cycles.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 111",660
69,"2.8.4 Three Cycles
The Left Cycle
The left cycle is the story of how the revolutionary class becomes the ruling class.
Thinkaboutthefollowingconcepts: ChristianKing, ProtestantEstablishment, Repub-
lican Conservative, Soviet Nationalist, CCP Entrepreneur, or Woke Capitalist. Each
of these compound nouns has within it a fusion of a once-left-associated concept and a
right-associated one.
That preﬁx is important: once-left-associated. At one point, Christians led a revo-
lutionary movement against the Roman Empire, Protestants led a decentralist move-
ment against the Catholic Church, Republicans led an abolitionist movement against
the South, the Soviets led an internationalist movement against the nationalist White
Russians, the CCP led a communist movement against the capitalists, and the Wokes
led a critical movement against American institutions.
But then they gained power, and with power came new habits. The revolutionary
left that justiﬁed the riseto power morphed partially into an institutional right that
justiﬁed the useof power. By its nature, a revolutionary group adopts leftist tactics
to gain power, but once it wins, ﬁnds it needs to use rightist tactics to maintain power
against a new crop of leftist insurgents. Lenin promised land, peace, and bread — then
Trotsky quickly organized the Red Army. Thus does the leftist revolutionary rebuild a
rightist hierarchy.
If you told this in story form, a manifesto-motivated group of revolutionaries would
ﬁght the man and gain power, only to have some Stalin character compromise the
revolution, capture it, and just become the man all over again. Then you’d need a new
manifesto and revolution against that order. The excellent short ﬁlm Dinner for Few
captures much of this dynamic.112 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
If we take the 1000-year view, this is the long cycle that starts with Christian revolu-
tionaries tearing down the Western Roman Empire by 476 AD, gives eventual rise to
the ruling Catholic Church and Holy Roman Empire, and then (1000+ years later!)
sees Martin Luther nail his Ninety-ﬁve Theses to the Church of Wittenberg in 1517
AD as a new manifesto that spawns a whole new crop of Protestant revolutionaries.
Is there any alternative to this cycle, to a ruling class gaining power at the end of the
revolution? Well, if a revolution doesn’t result in somekind of order, it looks more
like a Pol Pot or Seven Kill Stele scenario, where the “revolution” is kept up through
endless killing. Something like that may be how past civilizations collapsed.
Thus,somekind of order after the revolution is preferable. That brings us back to the
left/right titrations: Christian King, Protestant Establishment, Republican Conserva-
tive, Soviet Nationalist, CCP Entrepreneur, Woke Capital. Each of them justiﬁes the
new ruling class, the new order, with the language of the revolutionary class.
Note also that not every one of these titrations has exactly equal fractions of revolution
and institution. But the model happens repeatedly through history. A successful
revolutionary class becomes the institutional class, then a realignment happens, and
the new institutional class encounters a new revolutionary class.
The Right Cycle
The right cycle is the story of this epistle: strong men create good times, good times
create weak men, weak men create hard times, and hard times create strong men.
Here’s the visual:2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 113
Thiscyclestartsfromtherightandbecomesleft. Ifweturnedthisintoastory, it’dstart
with the rise of a small group of highly aligned Spartans. They grow on the borders
of empire, so-called “marcher lords” with a strong sense of ingroup spirit, what Ibn
Khaldun would call asabiyyah . Then they radiate out and start conquering the world.
Their indomitable will carves a swath through the degenerate empire that surrounds
them. They eventually achieve total victory. Strong men create good times.
But as they scale, they can no longer do everything on trust and need to start imple-
menting processes and taxes. They also start attracting lazy parasites to the wealth
they’ve created, people who want to join something great rather than build something
great. And they have within their walls many of the people they just conquered, who
don’t share their values and indeed didn’t much like being conquered. No one wants to
work as hard or be as ruthless as that early Spartan band, given the easy wealth now
available, so they enjoy themselves and busy themselves by ﬁghting with each other
over triﬂes. So good times create weak men.
Eventually this bureaucratic, disaligned, decadent empire falls to a new band of Spar-
tans from the outside. And thus do weak men create hard times, and in turn fall to
strong men.
The Libertarian Cycle
The libertarian cycle is the story of how a libertarian founder rebuilds the state.
First, alibertarian(ish)founderleavesthestiﬂingbureaucracyofabigcompanytostart
their own. Most immediately fail, but through pure maneuver warfare and relentless
execution, that founder might be able to make enough money to hire someone. In the
early days the most important quantity is the burn rate. Every single person must be
indispensable.
Eventually, if successful, the company starts building up some structure. Conserva-
tivism takes over. With the business growing consistently, the founder adds structure,114 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
career tracks, and a stable hierarchy. Now the most important quantity becomes the
bus number, the number of people who can get hit by a bus such that the company is
still functional. Suddenly every single person must now be dispensable .
This is like the transition from unicellularity to multicellularity. The founder has to
invest in a bureaucracy that impersonalizes the company and turns every employee into
an interchangeable part. Otherwise, one person could quit and crash the company.
Around this time, the parasites start entering. They don’t want the risk of a small
or even mezzanine-size business. They want lots of perks, high salaries, low workload,
and the minimum work for the maximum return. They aren’t truly equity-aligned;
the company is just a job that pays the rent. The interchangeability actually attracts
them! Theyknowtheydon’tneedtopulltheirweight,thattheyaren’tthataccountable
individually for the business’ success or failure. The system will support them. This
behavior is rational for them, but it degenerates into entitlement, and eventually causes
collapse of the company’s business model, though this may take a very long time.
Finally, some stiﬂed employee decides to exit the stultifying bureaucracy and become a
libertarian(ish) founder, and the cycle starts anew. As per the helical theory of history,
all progress is on the z-axis: they build the company, scale a bureaucracy to assist with
that, see it take over, and incentivize the best to exit. Thus does the libertarian founder
rebuild the state.
The Uniﬁed Cycle
We can synthesize these into a uniﬁed theory of cycles.
•The left cycle starts with a group of revolutionary leftists that then become
institutional rightists.
•The right cycle starts with a group of determined rightists that then become
decadent leftists.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 115
•The libertarian cycle starts with a group of ideological libertarians that end up
building a bureaucratic state.
Ifyouputthemtogether,yougetrevolutionary,determined,ideologues(aleft/right/libertarian
fusion) whose glorious victory ends in institutional, bureaucratic, decadence (a diﬀerent
kind of left/right/libertarian fusion!)
Most people haven’t studied enough history to have an intuition for cyclicity on a
100-year or longer timescale. But many people arefamiliar with the lifecycle of suc-
cessful tech startups, which exhibit this behavior on a 10-year timescale. That’s about
the longest kind of experiment we can run repeatedly within a human lifetime. And
fortunately the results have been widely witnessed.
That is, within our lives, we’ve seen many examples of a startup disrupting an in-
cumbentthrough scrappy tactics, becoming the incumbent themselves, and then
employing incumbent tactics to defend itself against a new wave of startups coming up
against it.
We’vealsoseenﬁrsthandthatasuccessfultechstartupistypicallyaleft/rightfusion. It
has the leftist aspects of missionary zeal, critique of the existing order, desire to change",1998
70,"things, informal dress and style, initially ﬂat org chart, and revolutionary ambition.
But it also has the rightist aspects of hierarchy, leadership, capitalism, accountability,
and contractual order. If you only have one without the other, you can’t really build a
meaningful company. Right without left is at best Dunder Miﬄin Paper Company;
left without right is an idealistic co-op that never ships a product.
Finally, we’ve also seen that just like most revolutions, most startups do fail. Failed
startups don’t capture enough of the market for dollars, while the failed revolutions
don’t capture enough of the political market for followers. But those startups that do
succeedthen need to ﬁght oﬀ both startups and even bigger companies, until and unless
they become a global goliath themselves (which is rare!).
The uniﬁed theory is thus a centralization, decentralization, and recentralization cycle.
Therevolutionary, determined, ideologuesbreakawayfromtheestablishment, andthen
- if they succeed - build a giant centralized empire, which subsequently degenerates and
spawns the next set of revolutionary, determined, ideologues.116 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
New Boss: NotExactly The Same As The Old Boss
The concept we’ve described here isn’t Marxism, which doesn’t have the concept of
groupsshifting sides from left to right and vice versa. The Marxist tacitly stipulates
only one transition, where the “poor” beat the “rich” and usher in the inevitable age
of communism, and that’s it. There isn’t cyclicity in their theory of history. It’s a
one-way ascent to utopia.
The uniﬁed cycle theory is more similar to the plot of Animal Farm , where the “new
boss is just like the old boss,” Nietzsche’s concept of master religions, the Lessons
of History excerpt on systole/diastole, or Scott Alexander’s ﬁnite automata model.
These each tell a story of cyclicity; Orwell’s book is focused on elite cyclicity (“new
bosssameastheoldboss”), Durant’schaptertreatseconomiccyclicity, andAlexander’s
post discusses cultural cyclicity.
But the uniﬁed cycle theory is not about a perfect circle at all — the new boss may2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 117
be much better or worse than the old boss, may not be exactlythe same. It’s closest
to the helical theory of history, because we don’t necessarily come back to the same
place on the z-axis. Many of these revolutions may actually leave everyone worse oﬀ,
representing setbacks on the z-axis, just like many startups fail. There is however the
occasional crucial revolution — usually frontier-opening in some sense — that pushes
humanity forward on the z-axis and improves the world for the better.
Holy War Wins Wars
One way of thinking about the uniﬁed cycle theory is to fuse our theory of left as
revolutionary class tactics and right as ruling class tactics. A leader needs aspects of
both to win. The left gives the holy justiﬁcation to ﬁght the war, the right gives the
might to win the ﬁght, and together they allow that leader to prosecute a holy war.
To take two examples:
•Maowasacommunist, buthewasalsoabsolutelya“strongman” createdby“hard
times.” He had that rightist ruthlessness about him, and unlike the stereotypical
vegan paciﬁst of the libertarian left, his men were willing to impose capital pun-
ishment for any crime, real or imagined. Without some of that conventionally
right-coded physical might he wouldn’t have won against a Nationalist opposition
that was willing to use military force.
•Conversely, if you think of the Poles and Estonians revolting against the Soviet
Union in the 1980s, they weren’t only making conventionally right-wing argu-
ments for capitalism and nationalism and traditional religion, they were also
making left-wing arguments for democracy and free speech. Without some of
that conventionally left-coded humanism they wouldn’t have won against a So-
viet Union which claimed greater holiness.
The point is that in any holy war, the left is the word, and the right is the sword. It’s
the priest and the warrior; you need both.
The left programs the minds. The priests and journalists, the academia and media,
they imbue the warriors with a sense of righteous purpose. They also justify the conﬂict
tothemanybystanders, convincingthemtoeithernotgetinvolved—ortogetinvolved
on the warriors’ side. In this concept of left, the priests transmit a revolutionary zeal
that justiﬁes the war against the opposing order, blesses it, consecrates it, says it is
necessary and virtuous, motivates the warriors, boosts their morale, and turns them
into missionaries that can defeat any mercenary.
The right furnishes the resources. They bring the warriors themselves, the farmers and
the miners, the engineers and the locomotives, the rugged physicality, the requisite
hierarchy, the necessary frugality, the proﬁt and the loss, the determination and the
organization, the hard truths to keep a movement going that complement the moral118 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
premises that get a movement started, the point of the spear that prosecutes that holy
war.
Why do you need both right and left to win? Unless it’s a robot war (and we’ll
get to that later) you need high-morale ﬁghters, so you obviously need the rightist
component as we’ve deﬁned it. But the less obvious part is that you can’t win without
the leftist component either, because mercenaries will run out of morale well before
zealous missionaries.
Just to linger on this, the right often underestimates anything that’s non-physical.If
that describes you, don’t think of what the left does as just words, as woke slogans or
religious mumbo-jumbo. Think of what they’re doing as writing the social operating
system, the software for society, the code that coordinates huge numbers of human
beings towards a common goal by telling them what is goodandbad, permissible and
impermissible, laudable and execrable. All logical deduction or martial action is then
downstream of these moral premises.
To summarize: you really do need both the word and the sword to win a war, both
the left and the right. And that concept applies outside the context of literal war, to
a variety of large-scale political movements, because (to invert Clausewitz) politics is
war by other means.
Again, this doesn’t mean that every movement has a precise 50%/50% titration of left-
and right-wing concepts, nor that there is some globally optimum combination of X%
left and Y% right that works across all time periods and societies, nor that the “center”
always wins. The main point is that a moribund left or right movement can often be
energized by infusing ideas from the other side.
A group using right tactics often has a deﬁcit of zealous meaning, and is hanging onto
a ruling class position while forgetting why they need to justify it from scratch to
skeptical onlookers. Conversely, a group using left tactics often has a lack of hard-
nosed practicality, attacking the ruling class without a concrete plan for what to put
in its place come the revolution. Forming a left/right fusion that’s informed by these
concepts is quite diﬀerent from what we typically think of as a left/right hybrid, namely
passive centrism.",1808
71,"2.8.5 Four Flippenings
As Saul Alinsky put it in Rules for Radicals : “The Prince was written by Machiavelli
for the Haves on how to hold power. Rules for Radicals is written for the Have-Nots on
how to take it away.” One could imagine a third installation in that ﬁctional trilogy,
and it’d be about what happens when the Have-Nots win and become the Haves.
We call this a political ﬂippening, after the term from cryptocurrency. A ﬂippening is
when the #1 suddenly becomes the #2, and vice versa. It occurs when a revolutionary2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 119
class ﬂips a ruling class, only to become a new ruling class. The former ruling class
then gets pushed into oblivion...or becomes a new revolutionary class.
We’ll cover several ﬂippenings in this section: the left/right inversion of the white
working class, the American and global ﬂippenings of the last 100 years, a set of
historical ﬂippenings that put these dynamics in broader context, and the ongoing
ﬂippening between the ascending world and the descending class.
The Proletarian Flippening
Theﬁrstﬂippeningstoryisabouttheinversionoftheworkingclass. HowdidStakhanov
become Archie Bunker? That is, how did the white working class ﬂip from the core of
the left to the core of the right in one hundred years?
First: who’s Stakhanov, anyway? He’s the jacked Chad of socialist realism, the mythi-
cal Soviet worker who all the men wanted to be and all the women wanted to be with,
the one who supposedly shoveled the coal of ten men in one day, the comrade who was
a real bro, the guy in the “worker’s paradise” who somehow took no vacation time at
all. Here’s a pic of the (likely ﬁctional) Aleksei Grigorevich Stakhanov, from the 1930s.
And who’s Archie Bunker? Well, he’s the bigoted patriarch of a once-popular 70s
show called All in the Family . Bunker’s role was to get dunked on in every episode by
“Meathead,” his enlightened, college-educated son-in-law. He’s a foil for the TV show’s
writers, representing all that is benighted and backward in the world. And here’s a pic
of the (deﬁnitely ﬁctional) Archie Bunker, from 1971.
So: these are two verydiﬀerent portrayals of the white working class, just a few decades
apart! How did they ﬂip? Why did they ﬂip?
The Working Class as Revolutionary Rationale
In the ﬁrst half of the 20th century, the person all enlightened people claimed to care
about was the working man. The working man! Upton Sinclair’s book was for him.
Orwell and the Popular Front fought alongside Stalinists in the Spanish Civil War
for him. All the buckets of blood shed by Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin — all of that was
ostensibly for him. Hitler too claimed to be for the working man, the Aryan one of
course; the full name of his faction was the National Socialist German Worker’s Party.
In hearing both the communists and fascists tell it, the working man was the most
honorable, humble, put-upon, long-suﬀering victim of a ruthless capitalist class...and
also the brave, muscular, tough backbone of the necessary revolution.
That’s the context in which the Stakhanov posters (and their Nazi equivalents) went
up everywhere.
Of course, in practice, communism was slavery, because the workers had to surrender
100% of their earnings to the state. As such, the Stakhanov posters were more cynical
thananycapitalistbreakroominfographic. TheSovietworkercouldn’tprotest,couldn’t
strike, couldn’t change jobs, couldn’t really buy anything with his “salary.” And those120 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
were the lucky ones! The unlucky ones were forced by Trotsky to dig the White Sea-
Baltic Canal with their bare hands, or deported to Siberia by Stalin. As in Nazi
Germany, arbeitdid notmacht frei .
But, bethatasitmay, communismhad traction. Atitspeakitcovered“26%oftheland
surface of the globe.” It was a secular ideology that commanded the zeal of a religious
movement — pure State-worship, in our terminology, the total replacement of G-o-d
with G-o-v. Decades after it had somewhat calmed down in the post-Stalinist USSR,
it was in full murderous swing in the PRC and Cambodia. The political formula which
put the working man on a pedestal as the put-upon victim of the powerful enabled one
man after another to gain power worldwide — Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot,
Castro, Kim Il-Sung — and then enslave the working man in the name of liberating
him.
The Working Class as Revolutionary Obstacle
Thensomethinginterestinghappened. TheUSmanagedtoavoidcommunistrevolution
(barely — see Henry Wallace and Venona), scrape through the tumultuous 60s, and
split enough of the proceeds with the union workers that they identiﬁed with America
rather than the “godless Russian commies.” The physical manifestation of this was
the Hard Hat Riot in 1970, when American union workers beat up the “dirty hippies”
cheering for North Vietnam.
Now, suddenly, the heretofore ignored negative qualities of the working man were
brought to the fore. He was white, ﬁrst of all. And racist, sexist, and homophobic.
Ignorant, too. He needed to be educated by his betters. And thus All in the Family
with Archie Bunker began airing, depicting a very diﬀerent kind of working man. Not
Stakhanov, not the uber-Chad of socialist realism, not the star of “boy meets tractor,”
but an obese layabout that represented everything wrong with society — and who was
now the oppressor.
And who was he oppressing? Well, the newproletariat: women, minorities, and LGBT.
Demographicsthatdidn’thavethatmuchpoliticalpowerwhencommunismwasroaring
to dominance in the early and mid 1900s, but which gradually grew to represent >50%
of the American electorate — a political prize waiting for anyone who ﬁgured out how
to tap into it. A political arbitrage opportunity, if you will, where the value of the
arbitrage was measured in power rather than money.
And this is how the white working class moved from oppressed to oppressor. But one
more event had to happen: the fall of the Soviet Union.
Communism Was Centralized Left
The women/nonwhites/LGBT group of “minorities” (which >90% of the global popu-
lation belongs to, if you stop to think about it) gradually became the core justiﬁcation
for the New Left, just as the working class had been the justiﬁcation for the Old Left.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 121
But there was a transitional period.
For many years, the Western left still had a foot in both camps, with Soviet sympathiz-
ers coexisting with New Leftists.After all, the hippies punched by union workers had
been aligned with “Hanoi” Jane Fonda, and were pro-Communist or at least anti-anti-
Communist. They were “objectively pro-Soviet” using the terminology Orwell disliked.
Even as late as the mid 1980s, a lion of the Western left like Ted Kennedy oﬀered to
do a deal with the USSR if they supported him for the US presidency.
The Soviet Union wouldn’t be around forever, though. For a variety of reasons, ranging
fromthewarinAfghanistan, therejuvenationofAmericanmoraleanddefensespending
underReagan, thefreedommovementsinEasternEuropeandtheBaltics, andofcourse
the total failure of their own economy to produce consumer goods, the USSR was on
its last legs. Gorbachev inadvertently doomed the empire in his attempt to reform it,
by liberalizing speech along with economics at the same time. The double whammy
of glasnost and perestroika destabilized a once tightly controlled system. Gorbachev",1983
72,"did do a bit of cracking down (the raid on the Vilnius Tower comes to mind), but
fundamentally he wasn’t as ruthless as Stalin, and a critical mass of his people wanted
capitalist consumer goods anyway. So, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and
an attempted restorative coup by “hardliners” in August 1991, the whole evil empire
collapsed by Christmas Day 1991.
At this point the Western left was at a crossroads. In China, 13 years earlier, Deng
Xiaoping had managed to outmaneuver Mao Zedong’s chosen successors, throw the
so-called Gang of Four in jail, and turn China towards the “capitalist road.” Now, the
other big communist champion, the Soviet Union, was going down for the count.
It appeared that the centralized left , the left with a designated and identiﬁable leader,
the centralized left of the USSR and PRC, of Stalin and Mao...that centralized left
would eventually lose its nerve and be beaten by the centralized right of the United
States.
So, after 1991, there was no more centralized left, no more communism, aside from
holdouts like Cuba and North Korea that were of no global consequence. Instead it122 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
became all about the decentralized left, the fusion of the civil rights movement and
Foucaltian deconstructionism, what we now call wokeness.
Wokeness is Decentralized Left
If you’ll note, the wokes don’t have a single leader like Stalin. They have no single book
likeThe Communist Manifesto . They don’t even like to be named. This is notable for
a movement that is otherwise so interested in verbal prestidigation, in renaming things!
Regardless of whether people call them “politically correct” or “SJWs” or “wokes” or
what have you, they’ll try to scratch oﬀ the label and say that they’re just being “good
people.” (You, of course, they have no problem calling you all kind of names.)
You can call them Democrats, and that’s in the ballpark, but many wokes are more
radical than Democratic party candidates (though still vote for them) and many rank-
and-ﬁle Democrats still aren’t wokes.
You can also note that the boundaries of wokeness are ﬂuid. Anyone can just start
voicing woke rhetoric. You may even sympathize with some of their stated ideas (as
opposed to their actual practice). I do, in fact, at least with the motte version - who’s
against equal treatment under the law? Of course, it never stops there.
You can notice that they do have their symbols and hashtags and ﬂags (which, when
hoisted, indicate control of territory as any ﬂag does) but that they often shy away
from admitting that what they’re doing is deeply political. It’s again just being a “good
person.” Then they return to writing policies and renaming streets.
They do have organizations, many NGOs and media outlets, of which Sulzberger’s
NYT is perhaps the most inﬂuential. But there’s no single directing group, and there’s
a very long tail of sympathizers.
Put it all together: no single leader, book, name, or organization. So if the communists
werecentralized left, the wokes are decentralized left. If communists were like Catholics
folding into a single hierarchy, wokes are more like Protestants where anyone can set
up a shingle as a preacher.
Communism was State-ﬁrst, Wokeness is Network-ﬁrst
Just as an aside, there’s a subtlety if we apply the lens of the Leviathans. While
Communists were centralized, they were not entirelypeople of the State. The reason is
that they had both the Soviet state and the international Comintern network of spies
and revolutionaries. But they were primarily people of the State after 1917, as the
global movement was downstream of the Soviet government.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 123
Wokes are the opposite. They are primarily people of the Network, as their habitat is
outside the elected State. The control circuitry for the US government resides outside
it, in media, academia, nonproﬁts, and the unﬁreable civil service.
But just as the communists don’t control all states (though they wanted to), the wokes
do not control all networks (though they want to). Their major weakness is that they
donotyet have total control over the English internet, the Chinese internet, or the
global crypto networks. But the wokes are trying manfully to gain such control. And
the switch from glorifying Stakhanov to denouncing Archie Bunker actually helps with
this, as social media users are much more helpful in gaining power over the Network
than factory workers.
Why? In the 20th century, the factory ﬂoor was the scene of the action and communism
was all about the strike. This was a collective action that seemed to help workers,
by redistributing wealth from the hated bosses. Over the medium term, of course,
adversarial unionization actually harmed workers because (a) they had to pay union
dues that gobbled up much of the pay raises, (b) they got a second set of managers in
the form of the union bosses, (c) their actions lead to a reduction in competitiveness of
theirstrike-riddenemployer,and(d)intheeventtheircountryactuallywentcommunist
they lost the ability to strike completely. Nevertheless, union organizing helped the
communists gain inﬂuence over states. General strikes could bring entire countries to
a halt.
In the 21st century, the internet is the scene of the action and wokeness is all about the
cancellation. There’s no factory ﬂoor, no formal union leader, no centralized direction
from Moscow. Instead, anyone can decide at any time to use the rhetoric in the air to
lead a campaign against their “oppressor” in combination with others who subscribe to
one or more woke principles. It’s open source, it’s decentralized left.
Like the strike, the cancellation is a collective action that seems to help the “marginal-
ized”, by redistributing status from the hated oppressors to the cancellers. The likes,
retweets, and followers get redistributed in real-time. Over the medium term, however,
cancellation actually harms the “marginalized” because (a) everyone can now cancel
each other on some axis, making life highly unpleasant and (b) constant cancellation
leads to a low-trust society. Nevertheless, cancellation helps wokes gain control of net-
works. Social media swarms in the 2010s could bring tech executives to their knees,
just as general strikes in the 20th century could bring countries to a halt.
From Working Class to Wokest Class
So, that’s how Stakhanov became Archie Bunker. Once the US had integrated its
working class tightly enough to defuse its revolutionary potential, and centralized right
beat centralized left in the USSR and PRC, the left needed a new group it could use to
justify its revolution. It found it in the “marginalized” that it has now ridden to power124 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
as Woke Capital.From the working class, to the wokest class.
The American Flippening
The second ﬂippening is about the inversion of the Republican and Democrat parties
over the last 155 years. As context, most Americans know vaguely that the Republican
and Democrat parties “switched sides,” that Republicans were on the left in 1865 and
on the right by 1965, but not exactly howthat happened.
HowdidtheGOPmovefromthe“RadicalRepublicans” ofLincoln’stime, totheconser-
vativeRepublicansofmid-century, totheproletariantruckersofthepost-Trumpparty?
And how did Democrats go from secessionist Confederates to anti-anti-communist lib-
erals to woke capitalists?
The Short Version
The short version is that the Republicans gained moral authority after the Civil
War, used that to gain economic authority, then got critiqued by the (repositioned)
Democrats for being so rich, then lost moral authority, and consequently also lost eco-
nomic authority, bringing us to the present day. The Democrats were on the opposite
end of that cycle.
The 1865-2021 Cycle
Now the longer version.
Let’s warp back to 1865. Immediately after the Civil War, the Republicans had total
moral authority — and total command of the country. During the process of Recon-",1992
73,"struction and what followed, they turned that moral authority into economic authority,
and became rich by the late 1800s. After all, you wouldn’t want to have a Confederate-
sympathizing Democrat traitoras head of your railroad company, would you?
Gradually, the Democrats began repositioningfrom the party of the South to the
party of the poor. A major moment was William Jennings Bryan’s “Cross of Gold”
speech in 1896. Another huge move was FDR’s re-election in 1936, when black voters
shifted 50 points from Republican to Democrat, though they still voted Republican at2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 125
the municipal level.The wrap up was in 1965 when black voters moved another 10-15
points towards Democrats, though the civil rights era was really just the culmination
of a multi-decadal trend.
After 1965 the Democrats had complete moral authority. And over the next 50 years,
from 1965-2015, the Democrats converted their moral authority into economic author-
ity. You wouldn’t want a Republican bigotas CEO of your tech company, would you?
Now that cycle has reached its zenith, and a critical mass of high income and status
positions in the US are held by Democrats. Some stats and graphs will show the story.
Democrats have:
•97% of journalists’ political donations
•98% of Twitter employees’ political donations
•>91% of professors in the top US universities
•26 out of 27 of the richest congressional districts
•>77% of political donations from Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google
Meanwhile, the Republicans have by many measures become the party of the economic
and cultural proletariat. There are of course exceptions like the Supreme Court and
state legislatures which are majority Republican, but see this chart from the Brookings
Institute, which shows that >70% of US GDP is now in Democrat counties. See also
this set of graphs from 2019, and that’s beforethe money printing and small business
destruction that occurred during COVID. The dominance is even more total when one
thinks about cultural institutions.What’s the Republican Harvard — is it Bob Jones
University? What’s the Republican Hollywood — some guys on 4chan making memes?
So, Democrats have become the party of the ruling class, of the establishment. And
the Republicans are repositioning as the party of the proles, of the revolutionary class.
This is why you see Democrats doing things like:
•tearing up over the Capitol six months after tearing down George Washington
•denouncing free speech
•setting up disinformation oﬃces
•shifting from investigating the government to “investigating” the citizenry
•scripting the recruiting ads for the CIA and military
•putting Pride ﬂags on attack helicopters126 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
•advocating for corporations to ﬁre people at will
•defending deplatforming as a private property right
•embracing the national security establishment
•allocating two billion dollars for the Capitol Police
•approving 40 billion dollars for war
It’s like the quote from Dune: “When I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom
because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, I take away
your freedom because that is according to my principles.” Now that the Democrats are
strong, they are acting like rightists. And now that the Republicans are weak, you see
them acting like leftists:
•criticizing America’s imperial inﬂuence in the world
•opposing war and military aid
•not trusting the FBI or the police
•expressing qualiﬁed sympathy for America’s current rivals
•talking positively about unions
•introducing anti-discrimination laws to protect Republicans
•lobbying for free speech
This explains the weird ﬂip-ﬂops of American politics over the last few years. We’re
in a realigning time where many institutional things are ﬂipping from blue to red and
back before ﬁnally going bright blue or red. Free speech is now coded red, while the
FBI is now blue. Because Democrats are the ruling class now.
Note that this isn’t an endorsement of either side, just an observation that two ultra-
long-timeframe sine and cosine waves have now shifted into the opposite relative phase.
The parties that many identify with and implicitly think of as constant were not con-
stant. The radical Republicans attained socioeconomic power and their defense of this
order made them conservative; the reactionary Democrats lost socioeconomic power
and gradually repositioned as revolutionary. Now they’re ﬂipping again.
This doesn’t mean everything is ﬂipping, of course. Democrats are still pro-choice,
Republicans still pro-life. Republicans still have an institution or two, like the Supreme
Court and some states. Just as Democrats after the Civil War were very weak, but not
eradicated, and able to serve as spoilers.
However, the two parties have ﬂipped on all the institutional bits, even if many Repub-
licans maintain the Monty-Python-like pretense that the conservative America of their
youth has just suﬀered a ﬂesh wound, and many Democrats maintain the Soviet-like
pretense that the ruling class is still a revolutionary party. Mexico has a great name for2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 127
this kind of thing, the PRI or “institutional revolutionary party,” but there’s a more
familiar metaphor: the startup.
As noted earlier, a successful startup wants to thinkit’s still the scrappy underdog,
because that’s good for recruiting and morale. But now the Democrats are no longer a
startup. The party has completed a 155 year arc from the defeated faction in the Civil
War to America’s ruling class.
There’s a Ship of Theseus aspect to this, though. All the parts got swapped out, and
the parties switched sides, but somehow the triumphant Democrat coalition of 2021
ended up geographically and demographically similar to the Republican lineup of 1865:
Northeastern-centric liberals arrayed against conservative Southerners in the name of
defending minorities.
And if you go even further back in time, this mirrors the English Civil War of the 1640s.
Brieﬂy, the people that came to Massachussets were the ideological descendants of the
Roundheads, and the ones who settled Virginia 20 years later were the descendants
of the Cavaliers, so it isn’t a surprise that descendants of the same two tribes went
to war about 200 years laterin the mid 1800s, or that their ideological descendants
are gearing up for another conﬂict right about now. See Scott Alexander’s review of
Albion’s Seed for the quick version.
Not Everything Flipped
You could plot the geographical, demographic, and ideological coalitions of the two
parties over the last 155 years. You’d see a few diﬀerent staggered sine wave-like
phenomena before they snap into the funhouse mirror image of 1865 that is 2021. But
if we drill into the ideological aspects of the ﬂip we see some interesting things.
At the surface level, the symbols remain intact: Democrats and Republicans still use
the same logos, just like the Chinese Communist Party has kept the hammer and sickle
more than 40 years after Deng Xiaoping’s capitalist revolution. On a policy level, as
noted, not everything has ﬂipped: Democrats remain pro-choice, Republicans remain
pro-life. But on an ideological level, that’s worth a bit of discussion.
Certain kinds of people are born revolutionaries. So when the Democrats ﬂipped over
from revolutionary class to ruling class, when they shifted from (say) “defunding the
police” to funding the Capitol Police, the born revolutionaries got oﬀ the bus. It’s
not necessarily any one issue like the police, or military, or COVID restrictions, or
regulations – the trigger is diﬀerent for each person – but the common theme is that the
born revolutionary just has a problem with what they perceive as irrational authority.128 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Visualize the startup founder who just cannot adjust to a big company after an ac-
quisition, or the writer who just refuses to hold back a story because of his editor’s
political demurrals. Born revolutionaries of this stripe include Glenn Greenwald, Matt
Taibbi, Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, and many Substackers and tech founders. They just
can’t bend to the establishment. But they also have real disagreements with each
other, which is why they’re independents, and why they can’t mouth a party line. So
the born revolutionary is really far more anti-establishment, and hence today anti-",1986
74,"Democrat, than pro-Republican. Many of the most accomplished in tech and media
sharethischaracteristic–theydon’twanttolistentoauthoritybecausetheythinkthey
know better, and in their case they often actually do. They’re fundamentally insubor-
dinate and disobedient, rule breakers and novelty seekers, ideological rather than tribal,
founders rather than followers — and thus sand in the gears of any establishment.
Other kinds of people are ideologically predisposed in the opposite direction, to what
some might call “imperialism” and others could call “national greatness.” As the Re-
publicans fully ﬂipped over from ruling class to revolutionary class, and went from or-
ganizing the invasion of Iraq to disorganizedly invading the Capitol, the neocon types
like David Frum and Liz Cheney switched sides. In our tech analogy, these are the big
company executives who only join a company once it has 1000+ people and leave out
the back when the writing is on the wall. They’ll take less upside in return for less
downside, and are more focused on guaranteed salary and prestige. They’re cyclical,
as opposed to counter-cyclical like the revolutionaries. They follow the school-of-ﬁsh
strategy, goingwiththecrowdatalltimes. Andinthiscontext, theiranimatingcharac-
teristic is not so much that they’re “pro-Democrat” but that they’re anti-revolutionary.
Much of the national security state and military establishment is also like this; they are
fundamentally rule-followers, institutional loyalists, and top-down in their thinking.
So that means that right now, immediately after the American realignment, we see
all four types: (a) revolutionary class Democrats who still think of their party as the
underdog, (b) ruling class Republicans who similarly (as David Reaboi would put it)
“don’tknowwhattimeitis,” (c)revolutionaryanti-establishmenttypeslikeGreenwald,
and (d) ruling class anti-revolutionaries like Frum and Cheney.
Over time, if history is any guide, the independent thinkers will move away from
the ruling class to the revolutionary class, while a much larger group of herd-minded
followers will join the ruling class. Returning to our tech analogy, think about how
a few of the most independent-minded people have left Google, while many more risk-
averse people have joined it. At Google, there isn’t much of the early startup spirit left,
but there is a paycheck and stability.That’s similar to the dynamic that characterizes
the Democrats in their formal role as America’s ruling class: they largely control the
establishment, but they’re losing the talent.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 129
The Second American Civil War?
Returning to the previous section, is 2021 really just a repeat of 1865? Well, if history
is running in reverse as per the Future-is-our-Past thesis, maybe not. Maybe 1861-1865
has yet to happen; maybe the Second American Civil War is yet to come. We discuss
this possibility later in our sci-ﬁ scenario on American Anarchy .
However, if we really push on the historical analogies, there’s another factor that was
just incipient during the 1860s but that dominated the era to follow. After North-vs-
South slugged it out, America shifted its attention to the (Wild) West. Similarly, after
whatever Democrat-vs-Republican donnybrook might ensue, we may shift our focus to
tech.
Because technology is a third faction. A group that was once identiﬁed with the West
Coast before the pandemic, but is now best thought of as decentralized network.
At least, about half of it can be thought of in this way. The technology companies
still physically headquartered in Silicon Valley would likely be heavily involved on
the US establishment side in any Second American Civil War, providing surveillance,
deplatforming, anddigitalenforcementfortherulingclass. Butthedecentralizedglobal
technologists — those that are into the overlapping but quite diﬀerent movements that
are BTC and web3 — would have a very diﬀerent attitude. They may not really
be “pro-Republican”, but they would be anti-ruling-class, and especially against the
inﬂation and censorship the ruling class would need to support its war machine. Any
truly global, decentralized platform would natively resist censorship requests by the
US establishment.
That may be the next step in the American Flippening: the conﬂict between the
decentralized people of the Network and the centralized people of the State, between
global technology and the American establishment.
The Global Flippening
The third ﬂippening is about the global reversal of the last 30 years, where the com-
munist countries became ethnonationalists and the capitalist countries became ethno-
masochists. In this ﬂippening, the countries on the economic left moved to the cultural
right, and countries on the economic right moved to the cultural left. The ideologies
reversed, but the geopolitical rivalries remained the same.130 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
The visual above tells the story. The most right-wing country in the world is now
CCP China, the ethnocentric champion of the Han, the place where “sissy men” are
now banned from TV and whose self-admitted goal is irredentist reuniﬁcation. Its
core premise is ethnonationalism, which can be paraphrased as “Chinese people are the
best.”
Conversely, Woke America is to America as Soviet Russia was to Russia. It is the
most left-wing country in the world, the place where whites go to the back of the line
for vaccinations and the self-admitted sponsor of global revolution. Its core premise is
ethnomasochism, which can be paraphrased as “white people are the worst”.
At this point, you may be sputtering in disbelief, in which case I refer you to these
twofootnotes to give a tissue for that sputtering. You may think this is obvious, in
which case read this section only for entertainment. You may argue that the right and
left categories have no meaning; if so, go read the earlier section on the spatial theory of
voting and note that there’s always a ﬁrst principal component in any map of ideology
space. Or you just may be confused, contending that the US is still “conservative” and
China is still “communist,” and want proof of the switch.
So here’s the detailed argument.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 131
The Global Axis in 1988 was Politico-Economic
First, what was the political spectrum in 1988, right before the fall of the Berlin Wall?
From right to left:
•USA: center right under Reagan
•Western Europe (NATO): center / center right
•Switzerland: neutral center
•PRC: migrating right, less ideological, hard to place under Deng Xiaoping
•India: left, socialist
•USSR, Warsaw Pact: far left
I don’t think any of these ideological positions should be too controversial. These
countries explicitly identiﬁed themselves as conservative, socialist, or communist re-
spectively. India was socialist, but not a member of the Warsaw Pact and not pointing
guns at the West. China was nominally communist, but also not hostile to the West,
and entering the second decade of the capitalist reforms begun by Deng in 1978. The
US was the champion of the capitalist right in spots like Chile and South Korea, and
the USSR was the global sponsor of the communist left in places such as Cuba and
North Korea.
The Global Axis in 2022 is Ethno-Cultural
By 2022, what did the global political spectrum look like, right after the Russo-Ukraine
war?
•US Establishment: ethnomasochist far left, denoted by the Progress Flag
•Western Europe: center left, but with increasing variance
•BTC/web3: pseudonymous center
•India, Israel, Singapore, Visegrad: center right
•Republican America: nationalist right
•CCP China, Russia: ethnonationalist far right, the Z ﬂag and “We Will Always
Be Here”
The ﬁrst thing we note is that the major axis has shifted. The primary axis is no longer
the politico-economic axis of capitalism-vs-communism, but the ethno-cultural axis of
ethnomasochism-vs-ethnonationalism. Is it the ultimate evil for a state to consciously
represent its majority race (as America contends) or is it the ultimate good (as China",1988
75,"contends)? Or should it be neither, as the pseudonymous economy contends?
The second thing we see is that the middle has shifted. Switzerland is no longer
neutral, as it’s siding with the US now. Cryptocurrency and cryptography is now132 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Switzerland, what Obama called the “Swiss bank account in your pocket.” And – as
just noted – it oﬀers an ethical alternative to both American ethnomasochism and
Chinese ethnonationalism, namely pseudonymous meritocracy.
The third thing we note is that we don’t use the American ﬂag to represent the US
establishment as it is very much a disputed symbol, with some in the establishment
claiming it while others claim it is disturbing. So instead, we use the Progress Flag
for the US establishment as (a) this is proudly raised by the State Department and in
the White House and (b) it sharply distinguishes the establishment from a Republican
America that very much does notﬂy the Progress Flag, but might instead ﬂy the Thin
Blue Line ﬂag or (eventually) the ﬂag of Bitcoin Maximalism.
The fourth thing (which is not on the ﬁgure) is that we don’t think of Republican
America as coincident with the US establishment anymore. That’s because the US
is abinational state with two warring ethnicities (Democrat and Republican) rather
than a single nation state. We didn’t put a separate Republican ﬂag on the ﬁgure,
though, as placing it on the nationalist right would seem to cluster it near China, and
Republicans dislike China as much as they dislike the Democrats. So you need to go
to more dimensions than just a linear axis, which we discuss in the next chapter on
NYT/CCP/BTC .
The ﬁfth thing we note is that Europe is now broadly to the rightof the US Estab-
lishment on ethno-cultural issues, whereas it was to the left of the US in 1988. (See
Macron and Orban’s comments, for example, if this isn’t on your radar.)
The last and most important thing is that this is a rough inversion of the 20th century,
as the formerly communist/socialist countries are on the ethnocultural right, while the
capitalist bloc is on the ethnocultural left.
Evidence for the Global Political Spectrum of 2022
How can we establish that this ethnocultural axis is a reasonable one-dimensional
representation of reality? Let’s do it in stages.
1.Existence of an axis. First, the #1 and #2 powers of this era are the US and
China, establishing these as the poles of someaxis in the ﬁrst place.
•Here’s a graph of global GDP, showing the US and China as #1 and #2.
•Here’s a graph of global military power, again #1 and #2.
•Here’s Ian Bremmer’s G-2 concept.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 133
•And here are several books and articles that talk about this include Destined
for War,The United States vs. China (FT review), and Getting China
Wrong.
2.Unity of NYT, Harvard, and Democrats as the US Establishment. Next, let’s
establish that there is alignment between America’s informal government (NYT,
Harvard, etc) and the formal government (elected Democrats and career bureau-
crats). Basically, we want to show that (a) this an interconnected social network
and (b) it is on the ethnomasochist left.
•The Progress Flag was raised over the U.S. State Department and
•The Progress Flag is raised in the White House by the US Press Secretary
and a Navy Admiral
•97% of journalists’ political donations went to Democrats
•90.1% of Harvard students voted Democrat
•98.82% of partisan contributions at Harvard’s FAS went to Democrats
•90% of professors at top universities are Democrat
•NYT’s use of ethnomasochist words went exponential in the 2010s
•The graphs in Yglesias’ article on the Great Awokening show that white
Democrats are to the cultural left of black Democrats on many issues
3.NYT denunciation of entities to their right. Third, let’s show that the US estab-
lishment’s leading paper, the New York Times, has run articles indicating that
China, Russia, India, Israel, Singapore, Hungary, and France are “fascist” and
“authoritarian” and hence to its right. We note that none of these countries are
being denounced as “communist” or to NYT’s left.
•China: “Can China Be Described as ’Fascist’?”
•Russia: “We Should Say It. Russia Is Fascist.”
•India: “The Rise of Modi: India’s Rightward Turn”
•Israel: “Israelis May Have Committed Crimes Against Humanity in Gaza
Protests, U.N. Says”
•Singapore: “David Marshall, 87, Opponent Of Singapore Authoritarianism”
•Hungary: “He Used to Call Viktor Orban an Ally. Now He Calls Him a
Symbol of Fascism.”
•France: “France’s Far Right Turn”
4.China and Russia are to the cultural right of the US. Next, let’s establish that
China and Russia take culturally conservative positions on marriage and family
that put them substantially to the right of today’s West.134 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
•Russia: see their actions in favor of “traditional families”, and Richard Hana-
nia’s piece on Russia the “Great Satan in the Liberal Imagination”.
•China: read about their ban on “sissy men” and promotion of traditional
marriage and family.
5.Europe is also to the cultural right of America. Now, let’s show how European
countries have put out statements noting that they are actually alsoto the right
of America on ethnocultural issues, albeit not as far from the US as China and
Russia are.
•France on wokeness: Macron, France Reject American “Woke” Culture
That’s “Racializing” Their Country
•Visegrad on immigration: Visegrad Four grouping push back on new EU
migration plan
•UK on immigration: The UK’s “Anti-Refugee Bill”: What Everyone Should
Know
So if you put all those together, we have (a) the existence of a US/China axis, (b) a
group of institutions that can be reasonably regarded as the voice of the US establish-
ment, (c) a set of NYT denunciations of other countries as being to the right of the US
establishment, (d) positions from China and Russia that are far to the ethnocultural
right of the US establishment, and (e) a set of statements from European heads of state
like Macron and Orban indicating that the US establishment is also to their left.
Note that even if you dispute the absolute position of any given country on this axis,
it’s now hard to argue with their relativeposition. That is, if you click the links above,
you’ll see that NYT does think of Russia and China (and France, Hungary, India,
Israel, and so on) as all being to its right on ethnocultural matters. And Russia and
China do think of the US establishment as being to their left on the same things.
I belabor this point because it’s somewhat implicit. The capitalist-vs-communist di-
vide of the 20th century was an oﬃcial, declared economic divide. By contrast, today’s
ethnonationalist-vs-ethnomasochist divide is an unoﬃcial, undeclared cultural divide.
It is nevertheless the primary global axis of conﬂict, and a very real reason for hos-
tility between the Sino-Russians and the US Establishment.Even if the geopolitics
have remained similar, with the Chinese and Russians of Mackinder’s world island still
aligned against the Anglo-Americans, the ideologies have ﬂipped.2.8. LEFT IS THE NEW RIGHT IS THE NEW LEFT 135
The Historical Flippenings
Our fourth ﬂippening story is a survey of historical ﬂippenings. How did the revolu-
tionary class become the ruling class, through history?
•From Christian crash to Christian kings. Early Christianity was the original
communism; it delegitimized and then tore down the Roman Empire. Then,
many generations later, the Holy",1999
76,"Roman Empire that consciously took the name
ofitsdistantpredecessorturnedChristianityintowhatNietzschecalleda“master”
religion, one that fortiﬁed hierarchy rather than undermining it. Christians were
on the left in Roman times as the revolutionary class. Then, upon winning,
descendants of those Christians eventually went to the right as the ruling class.
•From Protestant heresy to WASP establishment. Much later, Martin Luther be-
gan a Protestant insurgency against the Catholic Church / Holy Roman Empire.
Even later than that, descendants of these Protestants made it to the US to give
rise to the WASP aristocracy! Protestants were on the left as the revolutionary
class. Then upon winning, eventually descendants of those Protestants went to
the right as the ruling class.
•From ChiCom revolutionary to princeling. Today’s Chinese Communist Party is
another example. What do people call the descendants of the early Communists,
who fought both the Japanese and the Chinese Nationalists under Chiang Kai-
Shek to gain full control of China? Why, they are princelings . A more cut-and-
dried example of the transition from revolutionary class to ruling class would be
hard to ﬁnd.
•From marginalized minority to Woke Capital. And perhaps the most important
contemporary example is Woke Capital. The women, minorities, and LGBT
groups that replaced the working class as the Democrat party’s base are now to
Woke America what workers and peasants were to Soviet Russia: their mascots,
with all politics done in their name. It didn’t really matter to the communists
that workers and peasants actually went to the gulag in the Soviet Union, and it
doesn’t really matter to the wokes if women and minorities actually suﬀer from
crime and inﬂation in Woke America – what matters for the movement is the
power gained by the rhetoric.
So the CIA and Army now frontpage their female spies and soldiers. The US
State Department tells us Black Lives Matter. And when American helicopters
descend on their targets they do so while ﬂying the rainbow ﬂag. The meme
is now real: wokeness now justiﬁes American nationalism just as Communism
rationalized Russian imperialism. It’s what tells those pulling the triggers that
they’re killing for a higher cause, that they’re morally superior to those in the
gunsights. It’s the revolutionary ideology that justiﬁes the ruling class.

78,"2.9.1 Communities are Causes First, Companies Second
Every new startup society needs to have a moral premise at its core, one that its
founding nation subscribes to, one that is supported by a digital history that a more
powerful state can’t delete, one that justiﬁes its existence as a righteous yet peaceful
protest against the powers that be.
To be clear, it’s a huge endeavor to go and build an entire moral ediﬁce on par with a
religion, and work out all the practical details. We’re not advising you come up with
your own Ten Commandments!
But we do think you can come up with onecommandment. One new moral premise.
Just one speciﬁc issue where the history and science has convinced you that the estab-
lishment is wanting. And where you feel conﬁdent making your case in articles, videos,
books, and presentations.
These presentations are similar to startup pitch decks. But as the founder of a startup
society, you aren’t a technology entrepreneur telling investors why this new innovation
is better, faster, and cheaper. You are a moral entrepreneur telling potential future
citizens about a better way of life, about a single thing that the broader world has
gotten wrong that your community is setting right.
By focusing on just one issue, you can set up a parallel society with manageable com-
plexity, as you are changing only one civilizational rule. Unlike a political party, you’re
not oﬀering a package deal on many issues that people only shallowly care about. With

by recruiting people online to voluntarily form an alternative society that shows a
better way. The implication is that a startup society is still pretty small and near the
beginning of its ambition, just like a startup company.2.9. THE ONE COMMANDMENT 137
Aparallel society is roughly equivalent to a startup society, but the implication is that
it could be much larger in scale. It’s parallel because it stands apart from mainstream
societyasaparallelversion, asafork. It’snotsetupin opposition tothemainstreamon
every dimension, but a parallel society iscertainly diﬀerentiated from the mainstream
on a key axis.
You can think of the relationship between “startup society” and “parallel society” as
similar to the relationship between “startup” and “tech company”; the former is early
stage, while the latter can be of any stage.
The analogy works in another way. Just like a “tech company” can refer to a fully
remote organization, a partially physical company with some oﬃce space, or a globally
recognized multinational like Google, a “parallel society” is also an umbrella term that
can denote a wholly digital network union, a partially physical network archipelago, or
a diplomatically recognized network state.
That’s important, because you may be able to realize the goals of your startup society
with a purely digital network union, you may need the physical footprint of a network
archipelago, or you might need the formal legal recognition of a full network state. It
all depends on the nature of your one commandment: can it be accomplished purely
at the community level, does it require a physical buildout, or does it require changes
to the legal system?
A few speciﬁc examples will make this clear. We’ll describe startup societies based on a
wholly digital network union, others based on a partially physical network archipelago,
and yet others that need diplomatically recognized network states.",912
79,"2.9.2 Examples of Parallel Societies: Digital Network Unions
Renewal Culture: the Cancel-Proof Society
Let’s start with an easy example of a one commandment-based startup society, which
only requires a purely digital network union and doesn’t require a full physical footprint
like a network archipelago, let alone diplomatic recognition like a network state.
This is the cancel-proof society.
Suppose you’re the hypothetical founder of this startup society. You begin with a
historyofthelast15yearsshowingallthebizarreexamplesofsocialmediacancellation,
something like Jon Ronson’s So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed .
You note that these cancellations represent a moral failure by the people of the State
and the CEOs of the Network. Their partisan warfare and engagement algorithms
trapped many innocents in the crossﬁre of social war. Now a stray comment by a
civilian is routinely turned into a human sacriﬁce to make an ideological point. It’s as
if a passerby took such oﬀense to your oﬄine comment to a friend that they opened
ﬁre.138 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Those who agree that normal online behavior shouldn’t come with risk of a social
death penalty imposed by random people are the basis of your new society. They agree
with your historically informed, moral critique. And the one commandment may be
something like “cancellation without due process is bad”.
How do you implement this? One solution is just a network union that provides a
combination of (a) guild and (b) cancellation insurance.
You assemble a group of people in a Discord, optionally take a stake in each other by
issuing a DAO token, and work together to promote each other’s work and help each
other out. This could be a guild of, say, graphic designers or young adult ﬁction writers
or electrical engineers. The token of the DAO would be optional – it wouldn’t be meant
to be some massive new thing like Ethereum. It’s just a way to record who contributed
time and/or money to the startup society, and how much they did. People would give
in order to get, a bit like StackOverﬂow Karma. And those with more money than
time may buy the token to support those in the guild with more time than money.
Now, 99% of the time this startup society is just doing “peacetime” activities, like
helping people ﬁnd jobs, organizing promotion for new product launches of members,
facilitating introduction, or just hanging out at meetups.
But 1% of the time someone in the guild is under social attack. In that situation, the
guild can choose to publicly respond as one or — if grievously outnumbered — can
quietly support the aﬀected party with a new job after the uproar has died down. In
such a circumstance, the one commandment kicks in, and there is internal due process
around the attempted cancellation. Did the person actually do something wrong, and
if so, is the correct penalty more like a hundred-dollar ﬁne or an apology rather than
a career-ruining publicly calumny?
The concept is that this kind of startup society serves a dual purpose: it’s useful in
“peacetime” but it also gives people a community to fall back on in the event of digital
cancellation. And that’s how one could build a cancel-proof culture.",797

Keto Kosher: the Sugar-free Society
Next, let’s do an example which requires a network archipelago (with a physical foot-
print) but not a full network state (with diplomatic recognition).
This is Keto Kosher, the sugar-free society.
Start with a history of the horrible USDA Food Pyramid, the grain-heavy monstrosity
that gave cover to the corporate sugariﬁcation of the globe and the obesity epidemic.
Also discuss the cure in the form of keto and low-carb diets.
Then operationalize this cure in the form of a partially physical network archipelago.2.9. THE ONE COMMANDMENT 139
Organize a community online that crowdfunds properties around the world, like apart-
ment buildings and gyms, and perhaps eventually even culdesacs and small towns. You
mighttakeanextremesugarteetotallerapproach, literallybanningprocessedfoodsand
sugar at the border, thereby implementing a kind of “Keto Kosher.”
You can imagine variants of this startup society that are like “Carnivory Communities”
or “Paleo People”. These would be competing startup societies in the same broad area,
iterations on a theme.
If successful, such a society might not stop at sugar. It could get into setting cultural
defaults for ﬁtness and exercise. Or perhaps it could bulk purchase continuous glucose
meters for all members, or orders of metformin.
Digital Sabbath: the Partially Oﬄine Society
Cars are on balance a good thing. But you can overdo them. Mid-century America
did. It obscured the San Francisco waterfront with ugly elevated highways, impeding
the walkability of this beautiful area. That highway was removed in the late 20th
century.And the removal was an acknowledgement that sometimes we can have too
much of a good thing.
24/7 internet connectivity is like that. It’s good that we’re doing things like Starlink,
to bring internet access to the entire world, to provide free online education, and to
get them into the global economy.
But it’s bad if you can never disconnect from the internet. That’s why apps like
“Freedom” aresopopular. That’swhypeopleusecommitmentdevicesliketimedcookie
jarstohidetheirphones. That’swhyappslikeTwitterandSnapchatgotpopularonthe
basis of artiﬁcial constraints, like limited characters or disappearing messages, because
they were optimizing for fallible humans rather than infallible machines. That’s why
Tsinghua cuts oﬀ the internet at night, why Apple now provides screen time metrics,
and why books like Atomic Habits andIndistractible sell so well.
What if this optimization for fallibility didn’t have to be an individual thing? What
if there were a society that helped you with internet distractions and self-control, that
recognized that the internet was good, but that times and places without the internet
were also good — just as cars are good, but a San Francisco waterfront without cars
is also good?
One way of accomplishing this would be a Digital Sabbath society where the internet is
just shut oﬀ at night, from 9pm to 9am. Some buildings and rooms would furthermore
be enclosed in Faraday cages, to put them oﬄine on purpose. Areas would start to
be ﬂagged as online and oﬄine areas, a bit like smoking and non-smoking areas on
planes. All internet use would be conscious and focused, as opposed to unconscious
and involuntary.140 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Over time, such a society could even try to build apps to give individuals back control
over their internet use, with open source machine learning tools running locally on
devices in a privacy-protecting way to prioritize notiﬁcations, block distractions, and
encourage productivity.
The Digital Sabbath society is an example of a network archipelago that’s focused on
improving self-control around internet use. For obvious reasons, you’d need a physical
footprint, and wouldn’t be able to do this purely digitally.",965
81,"2.9.4 Examples of Parallel Societies: Recognized Network

Your Body, Your Choice: the post-FDA Society
Now let’s do a more diﬃcult example, which will require a full network state with
diplomatic recognition.
This is the medical sovereignty zone, the FDA-free society.
You begin your startup society with Henninger’s history of FDA-caused drug lag and
Tabarrok’s history of FDA interference with so-called “oﬀ label” prescription. You
point out how many millions were killed by its policies, hand out t-shirts like ACT-UP
did, show Dallas Buyers Club to all prospective residents, and make clear to all new
members why your cause of medical sovereignty is righteous.
But to actually achieve personal medical sovereignty, your startup society would need
some measure of diplomatic recognition from a sovereign outside the US — or perhaps
a state within the US. It would need to actually be what we call a network state, as it
would need legal recognition from an existing government.
For the case of doing it outside the US, your startup society would ride behind, say, the
support of Malta’s FDA for a new biomedical regime. For the case of doing it within
the US, you’d need a governor who’d declare a sanctuary state for biomedicine. That
is, just like a sanctuary city declares that it won’t enforce federal immigration law, a
sanctuary state for biomedicine would not enforce FDA writ.
With this diplomatic recognition, you could then take the existing American codebase
and add one crucial new feature: the absolute right for anyone to buy or sell any
medical product without third party interference. Your body, your choice. That’s how
you’d get an FDA-free zone.",401
82,"2.9.5 Analysis of Parallel Societies
Now we see why a focused moral critique is so important. It combines (a) the moral
fervor of a political movement with (b) the laser-focus of a startup company into (c) a
one-commandment based startup society.2.9. THE ONE COMMANDMENT 141
Such a society is not a total revolution. We aren’t starting completely de novo. Each
startup society is simply taking a broken aspect of today’s world, often a State-caused
or at least State-neglected calamity, writing the history of that state failure, and then
building an opt-in community to solve the problem.
It’s a tightly focused parallel society making one impactful change.
Why Not More Than One Commandment?
Why is it so important to introduce onecommandment rather than zero or N?
The short answer is that you don’t want to write something as complex as a social
operating system from scratch, and in fact others will prevent you from doing so. But
you also don’t want to avoid innovating on a broken society. So introducing one (1)
tightly focused change at a time in a startup society with opt-in citizens allows testing
of the new commandment.
The longer answer revolves around an important paradox of modern society: namely,
thatmanypeoplefeeluncomfortableevangelizingreligiousmorals, yetverycomfortable
evangelizing their political ethics.
The ﬁrst part is easy to understand. Westerners are nowadays often shy about telling
others to practice their religion. Why? They may feel they haven’t ﬁgured it all out,
so who are they to say? Or they know they can’t live up to their ideal moral code,
like someone who wants to diet but can’t always restrain themselves, so they refrain
from commentary to avoid the charge of hypocrisy. They also may not want to be
attacked as a crazy cult leader. All of these are understandable hesitations for either
(a) evangelizing a traditional religion, (b) inventing a wholly new one, or (c) forking an
existingreligion. (Thelast iskindof like startinganew denominationofProtestantism,
where you keep much of the old codebase but add in some crucial distinctive factors.)
But think about the second part. While there is great hesitation in Western society
aroundreligious evangelism, there is seemingly no hesitation around political evange-
lism. Indeed, thisis considered an ethical duty, usually in exactly those terms, with
the word “ethical” used in place of “moral” but serving a very similar role, and with at
least two large competing political parties ﬁghting for the souls/votes of their believers.
Therein lies the paradox: while political and religious movements can both be con-
sidereddoctrines, in that they come packaged with a number of directives on how
peoplemustlive, the same person who is shy about telling other people about morality
is often incredibly conﬁdent when yelling at other people about politics.
That’s why we advise one commandment for your new startup society. It’s something
in between being too shy and too overbearing. It’s in between avoiding religious-
sounding evangelism entirely and indulging in political-sounding evangelism too much.
Don’t avoid taking a moral stance, because that means you passively succumb to your142 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
surroundings. But also don’t try imposing an all-encompassing political ideology to
start, because that’s too hard and means total warfare with your surroundings.
Instead, just pick oneﬂaw in modern society that you dofeel conﬁdent in building a
startup society to redress, and go with that. One commandment, not zero or N.
What About Older Doctrines?
Sofarwe’vetalkedaboutaonecommandment,butimplieditisa newmoralinnovation,
like cutting out sugar or limiting internet use. What about older religions, political
codes, and moral commandments?
You can certainly return to an older known religious code, adopting it in whole or in
part. In a startup society, where everyone opts in, you can make this happen more
easily because religion in many countries is mostly about private practice: so long as
people agree in a peer-to-peer fashion to practice their religion a certain way, the state
allows them to do it.
It’s harder to return to an older political code, because you are now talking about
public law rather than private law. Still, if you build a large enough startup society,
and pick the right laws, there is probably something at the town, city, or province level
that you can do — either within the West or outside it.",1079
83,"2.9.6 Parallel Systems Catalyze Peaceful Reform
How did the US beat the USSR? Because it built and defended a parallel system.
Rewind back to how the Soviet Union fell. As Stephen Kotkin noted in a brilliant
interview, the most important fact about the Soviet Union was that they genuinely
werecommunists. Outsiders perceived the Soviets to be cynical, but they were wrong;
their cynicism had limits. At the end of the day, the Soviets were devout believers in
their ideology.
How could it be otherwise? Soviet citizens weren’t stupid, and people knew there were
things that didn’t add up, but they were operating within a constrained information
environment. The censorship was so pervasive that it controlled thought. The degree
of self-deception was so all-encompassing that even the nomenklatura like Boris Yeltsin
didn’t know how truly poor the Soviet Union was till he visited an American supermar-
ket and threw up his hands at how far behind the USSR was. Unlike Orwell’s O’Brien,
the Soviet leaders deceived themselves too.
So, fundamentally, any proposed edits by Soviet elites to the USSR would have been
just on the margins. They were information and values constrained. They actually
needed a totally diﬀerent system. Yet their system resisted both revolutionary and
incremental reform.
The solution was the parallel system of the United States. An alternative society start-
ing from diﬀerent moral premises that eventually produced undeniably better results.2.9. THE ONE COMMANDMENT 143
That’s the same basic thing that reformed the People’s Republic of China. The mere
existence of successful parallel systems in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and especially Singapore
is what drove Deng Xiaoping to adopt capitalism. Ezra Vogel’s book is excellent on
this.
So, in both cases, it was a parallel system that beat the Soviet system and the Maoist
system.
Parallel Systems Once Required Contiguous Land, Now They Don’t
In the 20th century, the only way to build a parallel system was to ﬁght and win a war
(often a hot one) against the communists or fascists who were intent on conquering
your territory. The parallel systems of the US and Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan
were maintained against the USSR and PRC at enormous cost by ﬁghting for large
contiguous regions of land. That was a very State-centric approach.
In the 21st century, our approach suggests a Network-centric way to build parallel
systems: create one opt-in society at a time, purely digitally if need be, justifying it
with a historical/moral critique of the present system that delegitimizes State violence
against them and allows the experiment to continue.
Many will fail, but for those that succeed, we can merge together the good changes and
discard the bad ones, and eventually get a parallel society that diﬀers in many respects
from (say) the original US codebase, but that maintains enough similarity that it’s
“backwards compatible” and citizens can migrate over. Much like the relation of the
USA to Europe during the 1800s, this is a way to reproducibly build a New World on
the internet to reform existing states.",718
84,"2.9.7 Four Points on One Commandments
Let’s review.
First, by starting with a seemingly simple moral premise and taking to its logical
conclusion, a one-commandment-based startup society ends up changing huge swaths
of life, but in a focused, exit-constrained, and intellectually consistent way.Just
think about what “keto” really means when it’s extrapolated out to the scale of an
entire town, and sugar poisoning is taken as seriously as lead poisoning.
Second, one-commandment-based societies allow for scalable, parallel, consensual ex-
ploration of sociopolitical space. Diﬀerent groups that disagree with each other on how
tolive canneverthelesssupportthe meta-concept ofmany diﬀerent one-commandment-
based experiments. And indeed, both a carnivore community and vegan village would
likely have better health outcomes than the default Western diet, even if these com-
munities disagree on core moral premises.144 CHAPTER 2. HISTORY AS TRAJECTORY
Third, there’s a network eﬀect between societies. Each starts oﬀ highly focused, of
course — much as a startup company tries to attract customers with a single focused
product, each startup society tries to attract subscribers with a single focused com-
mandment. And as with a startup company, any individual experiment towards a new
sociopolitical order may succeed or fail. But so long as someone-commandment-based
startup societies succeed, they can copy each other’s proven moral innovations.
Fourth, each of these one-commandment-based startup societies is supported by a
history. Listen to someone from the Keto Kosher society and they’ll be able to rattle
oﬀ an account of how the USDA Food Pyramid led to epidemic obesity. Chat with a
Benedictine Option monk and you’ll hear about the religious culture they’re trying to
preserve. And talk to a citizen of the post-FDA society and they’ll give you a history of
the few strengths and many weaknesses of the FDA, from ACT-UP to drug lag. Some
such societies are focused on new technologies and some are not, but all of them are
based on an ethical code premised on their reading of history. And that’s why history
is the foundation of any new startup society.",527
85,"3.1 NYT, CCP, BTC
Today’s world is becoming tripolar. It is NYT vs CCP vs BTC. That’s the American
Establishment vs the Communist Party of China vs the Global Internet.
Each of these three poles has a source of truth online: paper (NYT), party (CCP), or
protocol (BTC). Each has a digital economy that surrounds that source of truth: the
dollar economy, the digital yuan, or the web3 cryptoeconomy. Each pole is a network
in its own right, which stands outsidethe state; the NYT network gives direction to
the American state, the CCP network leads the Chinese state, and the BTC network
stands outside all states. And each has a governing ideology.
•Woke Capitalis the ideology of America’s ruling class as explicated by America’s
rulingnewspaper,TheNewYorkTimes. It’scapitalismthatenablesdecentralized
censorship, cancel culture, and American empire. It’s drone-strike democracy.
•Communist Capital is the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party. It’s capital-
ism checked by the centralized power of the Chinese party-state, as summarized
here: Leninist, Confucianist, Capitalist, and Nationalist.
•Crypto Capital is the international ideology of Bitcoin and web3. It’s stateless
capitalism, capitalism without corporations, decentralized censorship-resistance,
and neutral international law. And it’s the second pole withinboth the US and
145146 CHAPTER 3. THE TRIPOLAR MOMENT
China, the one that domestic regime opponents align around.
While superﬁcial aspects of these ideologies may shift with circumstance, we claim
these are the only coalitions with the billion-person scale and technological talent to
survive as independent power centers in the all-out digital struggle that has already
commenced. They do have internal divisions, as we’ll get to, but for the time being
every group from companies to states to dissident factions withinstates will have to
navigate between these poles, the tripolar triangle of the digital world.",473
86,"3.2 The Dated and the Timeless
Before we go further, let’s note: anything written about current events is, by its nature,
likely to become dated.
It is possible, even likely, that the US Establishment sheds its skin once again, down-
playing wokeness and emphasizing loyalty to the state, just as they transitioned
overnight from the “Global War on Terror” to the domestic war on your tweets.
It is possible, although less likely, that George Soros, Peter Zeihan, Gordon Chang, and
Roger Garside eventually prove right, that Xi Jinping is displaced from his position
atop the Communist Party of China in the 2022 Party Congress, and/or that the CCP
switches back to “Hide your strength and bide your time.”
And it is possible, although less likely still, that there is some fatal ﬂaw, mathematical
breakthrough, or quantum computer that leads to the irreparable failure of the Bitcoin
protocol.
So why devote a chapter to the NYT/CCP/BTC model at all, if events can overtake
it? Three reasons.
First, we need somemodel of where the world is, even if imperfect, to steer it where
we want to go. Even if it’s wrong, or wrong in some particulars, it may be usefully
wrong in that the update shows us where we were wrong. We spend the energy to
describe a speciﬁc tripolar model of the world becausemany still think it’s unipolar
or bipolar, as illustrated by this amusing interaction between a journalist and Indian
Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar.
Second, even if major changes do occur, the decline of American empire, the rise of
China, and the ascent of cryptocurrency remain underlying trends involving hundreds
of millions of people that would require tremendous force to stop. We’d notice. And
we consider a few candidates for such tremendous forces later.
Third, there are aspects of the current moment that are not dated at all, but recurrent.3.3. A BIPOLAR AMERICA AND A TRIPOLAR TRIANGLE 147
That is, a similar tripolar conﬁguration has occurred before. But ﬁrst let’s establish
how it came about today.",501
87,"3.3 A Bipolar America and a Tripolar Triangle
In 1990, as the USSR was clearly falling apart, Charles Krauthammer wrote an inﬂu-
ential essay called the Unipolar Moment. It made the point that with the Cold War at
an end, the US was the sole dominant power on the planet, and would be for roughly
a generation, after which point “multipolarity will come in time.”This thesis held up
well: unipolarity was true in the 1990s, mostly truein the 2000s, much less true with
the rise of Asia, technology, and American polarization in the 2010s, and no longer true
in the 2020s.
As of 2022, we no longer have a unipolar world. Nor is it just ambiguously multipolar,
with an unspeciﬁed number of power centers. Instead, we have a bipolar America and
a tripolar triangle. And we can visualize these poles as follows:
148 CHAPTER 3. THE TRIPOLAR MOMENT",224
88,"3.4 Moral Power, Martial Power, Money Power
In the mid-20th century, the decline of the British Empire presaged a three way ﬁght
between a moral power, a martial power, and a money power — roughly, left vs right vs
center. Back then, the Soviet Union was the moral power, the Nazis were the military
power, and the Americans were the money power. Today, NYT is the moral power,
CCP is the martial power, and BTC is the money power.
In each case, we also ﬁnd that the moral power plants moles for espionage, the martial
power excels at manufacturing, and the money power leads in media. But while in the
mid-20th century these three powers were states, today they are primarily networks.",170
89,"3.4.1 Moral State, Martial State, Money State
Back up for a second. How could we possibly say that an entity like the USSR, which
killed millions of people, was a “moral” power? Because the USSR’s primary strategy
wasCommunistproselytization, theunceasingevangelismofamalign(butconvincing)
moral doctrine that managed to capture more than a third of the earth’s population
by mid-century. It did have a colossal military, but spoke endlessly of peace; it seized
everyone’s property, but claimed it didn’t care about money; and its self-image was
that of saintly selﬂessness. It is in this sense that the Soviet Union was a moral power .
Its moral powerallowed it to plant moles in every country, which compensated for its3.4. MORAL POWER, MARTIAL POWER, MONEY POWER 149
lack of money and manufacturing. American sympathizers funded the buildout of the
Soviet state, handed it diplomatic recognition, distracted Japan on its behalf, supplied
it with the Lend-Lease Act during WW2 and nuclear weapons afterward, and generally
propped up the USSR throughout its life.
Nazi Germany also infamously murdered millions of people. While similar to the USSR
in many respects, its primary strategy was diﬀerent. It was an emphasis on martial
valor,onpurebruteforce,ontheshellsthatwouldsupposedlyhisslouderthananymere
words. It did have an inescapable propaganda apparatus, but its moral preaching was
martial; it did leave some money-oriented businesses intact, but said it was socialist;
itsraison d’être was ruthless self-interest. It is in this sense that Nazi Germany was a
martial power .
Tosupportthismartialpower, theGermansneededatremendousmanufacturingbuild-
out, which they accomplished. Many historians believe the German military had, on
a pound-for-pound basis, the best equipment in the war. But because they lacked
the capitalist’s ability to cooperate across borders, they drove away some of their best
scientists prior to murdering others, ensuring they’d never gain the atomic bomb. And
because their morality amounted to Aryan supremacy, which didn’t appeal to anyone
other than their co-ethnics, they never managed to build a large enough global coalition
to win - which is why the 70M Germans were eventually beaten by the 50M British,
the 150M Americans, and the 150M Soviets.
As for the mid-century Americans, their primary strategy was democratic capitalism,
as opposed to Soviet communism or national socialism. They preached a morality,
but framed it in terms of a capitalist-friendly four freedoms; they built an arsenal of
democracy, but it arose from their commercial industrial base. It is in this sense that
WW2 America was a money power .
Accompanying the money power was media power, just as capitalism went with democ-
racy. The Americans were much better at media than the Nazis (who couldn’t argue in
English) and incrementally better than the Soviets (whose propaganda was ultimately
undermined by their lack of prosperity). The media battle was a close-run thing, but
in the end blue jeans out-competed the Red Army.
So: in this tripolar conﬁguration, after a titanic struggle, the money power in the center
didend up winning over both the martial power on the right (by 1945) and the moral
power on the left (by 1991).150 CHAPTER 3. THE TRIPOLAR MOMENT",811
90,"3.4.2 Moral Network, Martial Network, Money Network
Today, the decline of the US empire has led to the rise of a moral power (represented
by NYT), a martial power (CCP), and a money power (BTC). The diﬀerence relative
to mid-century is that each of these are networks that are upstream of states, rather
than primarily states themselves.
NYT: The Moral Network
TheNYT-centerednetworkofjournalists“hold[s]powertoaccount” andtherebystands
above any mere elected government. Its go-to tactics are moral badgering and mole-
driven espionage, just like the Soviet Union.
On the moral point, go back and look at any recent NYT headline and note how many
of the articles involve a moralrather than factual premise as the core point. Free
speech is bad, white people are bad, communism was good...this is the kind of thing
they are focused on.And it is in this sense that NYT is a moral power.
On the espionage point, as just discussed, we know that the Soviets were past masters
at subversion. Their moral convictions made them feel that invading the privacy of
others, stealing secrets, destroying lives with Zerzetsung— all of that was acceptable
for the great moral cause of communism. Because they weren’t as good at building as
the US or even Germany (the Soviet munitions came from America via Lend-Lease),
stealing/destroying was the best thing they could do.
Sulzberger’s employees and American journalists in general are similar. They’re the
Stasi with a stock symbol, the original surveillance capitalists. It’s always phrased in
the passive voice, but how exactly did “The New York Times obtain” the things they
print? The story behind the story is more interesting than the story, and the behind
the scenes footage would show you a diﬀerent movie than the one they want you to
watch.
In short, much like the communists, the journalists’ moral conviction gives them the
license to doxx private citizens, to go through people’s garbage, to use secret identities
(and then claim they don’t), to print hacked data, to solicit leaks of private information
while demanding to keep their own information private, to induce people to break
contracts, to stalk people at their homes, even to cover up enormous genocides and
start giant wars...always in the service of the bottom line, and some purported higher
good.
The establishment journalist claims to speak truth to power, but somehow never gets
around to investigating themselves or each other. As Bloomberg admitted in a moment3.4. MORAL POWER, MARTIAL POWER, MONEY POWER 151
of candor, they “report on but do not investigate Reuters and CNBC” because they
are “direct rivals”. We occasionally hear about incidents like the episode where ABC
got CBS to ﬁre the Robach leaker, or when NBC tried to stiﬂe Ronan Farrow’s work,
but those are the just the tip of the iceberg. There’s an enormous incentive for estab-
lishment journalists to engage in anti-competitive collusion, because if they all agree
on what is “true”, who can then fact-check them? No one can “hold accountable” those
with the power to hold the government accountable.
CCP: The Martial Network
This one may require the most explanation as it’s the most foreign to Western expe-
rience. First we’ll describe why CCP is primarily a network, and then why it’s now
mainlymartial. We don’t pretend to be China experts — few are! — but these are
relatively basic points that are still not that well known.
Why Is CCP a Network?
TheCCPnetworkofpartymembersislessseparatefromtheChinesestate, asitdoesn’t
pretend to be at a great remove from the levers of power as NYT does. But the party is
not thesameas the state. Indeed, there are 95 million CCP members, and they don’t
all have senior government positions anymore than every registered Democrat has a
plum spot in the Biden administration. Instead, they are spread out through society.
How does it work?
Joining the CCP is itself nontrivial, which selects for the most dedicated members.
TheSouth China Morning Post outlines the “arduous” application process:
An application must be ﬁled to the applicant’s closest party committee or
branch, with a letter explaining:
•why he is applying for membership,
•why he believes in the Communist Party, and
•areas in which he feels he has fallen short of the requirement to become
a member.
But it doesn’t end there, according to Merics:
Applicants must write essays on Marxism-Leninism and on current political
developments. Eight colleagues, neighbors and acquaintances have to vouch
for an applicant’s reputation.
After applying, the applicant must take courses and then pass an exam, only to then
be put into a yearlong (at least) probationary period:
The applicant will then attend party courses, where he will learn about
the party’s constitution, after which he will have to take and pass written
tests...152 CHAPTER 3. THE TRIPOLAR MOMENT
Upon passing the tests, the applicant will required to submit more materi-
als to the party branch, including personal information of himself and his
parents. Information about his employment and his parents’ political aﬃl-
iations also have to be disclosed. Probationary party membership will be
granted upon:
•passing the screening,
•being recommended by two party members, and
•discussions and approval after a meeting with the party branch...
Probation lasts at least a year. At the end of the probation period, the
party branch decides whether to admit the applicant, extend the probation
or expel him.
Lest one misbehave during the probationary period, there are consequences if the ap-
plicant does not behave up to strict standards:
In the ensuing one-year probation period, the admission process can still
be stopped if “party discipline” is breached.
And if you are ﬁnally cleared by the Party to join, you have a lifelong commitment to
uphold, as Mo Chen writes:
When the CCP hold a top tier meeting, you will be in your local party
branch conference room to watch it live, and write essay on thoughts after
view.
Natural disasters happen, donate, mandatory. Oh you don’t know where
to ﬁnd the donation box? Don’t worry, it is deducted already from your
salary...
Everytime the Chairman of China releases important article address the
issues of current aﬀairs and overarching strategy for the next ﬁve years,
you write that article 10 times, handwritten, due tomorrow. Thankfully,
these are like, once every ﬁve years.
If you break the law, no matter how small, you get a “Party Internal Warn-
ing” post. And yes, you write [a] reﬂection essay about what had led you
astray, and how wrong you realize you are... If it is serious, you are back to
probation period... even more serious? The double policy, you lose both
your party status and oﬃce title...3.4. MORAL POWER, MARTIAL POWER, MONEY POWER 153
Seems very alien to a Western mindset! What people would choose to constantly post
new essays regurgitating the latest in regime propaganda, and indoctrinating their
coworkers and family members? But it all ﬁts if you think of them as China’s New
York Times subscribers.
Think about this scene in Team America: World Police , where the Janeane Garofalo
ﬁgure says, “As actors, it is our responsibility to read the newspapers, and then say
what we read on television like it’s our own opinion.” Then, just swap out the NYT
mobile app with Xuexi Qiangguo .
As the saying goes, “Party, government, army, society and education, east, west, south
and north, the party leads on everything.” It’s almost the same for the American
Establishment, except the paperleads on everything. America’s CCP are its NPCs.
Why Is CCP Martial?
From 1978 to 2013, from Deng Xiaoping to Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao, the CCP was
focused on economic growth. But under Xi Jinping, it’s taken a turn towards militarist
nationalism. It builds most of the world’s physical products, its military budget is
already >1/3 that of America’s, it has a more focused task (“reunify China” rather
than “police the world”), it produces military recruiting videos like",2000
91,"We Will Always Be
Here, and - most importantly - it is investing heavily in AI and drones.
On that last point, China is just better at deployment in the physical world than the
US government or military, as we can see from (a) the public infrastructure comparison,
(b) the multibillion dollar failures of the American Ford-class aircraft carrier, the F-35
manned aircraft, the Littoral Combat Ship, and the Zumwalt destroyer, and (c) the
fact that all the manufacturing know-how and the factories themselves are in China.
Robotics could shift manufacturing out of China, but until then it is quite possible that
the “arsenal of democracy” is more like the “arsenal of communism.”
Note however that just because China becomes primarily a martial power does not
mean it will necessarily win a physical conﬂict. The Nazis too in our framework were
primarily a martial power, and did not win. Then again, while the Nazis were out-
numbered by the US/UK/USSR by a 5:1 ratio (70M to 350M), the Chinese outnumber
the Americans by a roughly 4:1 ratio (1.4B to 330M), so past performance may not be
predictive of future results.154 CHAPTER 3. THE TRIPOLAR MOMENT
BTC: The Money Network
This one is almost too obvious, so we won’t belabor it. The global network of BTC
holders in a key sense also stands abovestates, like the NYT network stands above the
American state and the CCP network stands above the Chinese state. Why? Because
it’s very hard for states to seize Bitcoin, in the absence of some kind of quantum
computing breakthrough.
But it’s primarily a money power rather than a moral power like NYT, or a martial
power like CCP.
The less-obvious point is that BTC — and its adjacent group of web3 users — are be-
coming a mediapower that will eventually topple the NYT, much as the 20th century
US’s media power eventually outcompeted that of the Soviet Union. Why? Decentral-
ized media. You can see early signs of this with Substack, Mirror, and NFTs...but in
brief, thebestcontentcreatorshavebetterthingstodothanworkfortheestablishment.
They can become publishers of their own, by founding their own media companies. As
with the CCP’s transition to a martial power, the BTC/web3 transition to a money
andmedia power is not at all conventional wisdom.",573
92,"3.4.3 Overlaps and Exceptions
Of course, these aren’t pure forms.
NYT is a publicly traded multibillion dollar corporation, and is certainly able to inﬂu-
ence the Fed and other huge ﬂows of money. And it can spur much of the US military
into action with a fake article or three. So it has money and martial power, even if it
is primarily a moral power.
CCP endlessly preaches to its citizens via Xuexi Qiangguo , and until recently was
focused entirely on business. So it has a moral and money power as well, though it is
becoming primarily a martial power.
Finally, Bitcoin certainly makes a set of implicit moral arguments: inﬂation is bad,
centralization is bad, pseudonymity is good, and the like. And it has a martial power,
though it’s entirely defensive, as the combination of encryption and physical decen-
tralization render it resistant to 20th-century-style military attacks. But it is, perhaps
obviously, fundamentally a money power.
One can do a similar exercise for the US/USSR/NSDAP triangle.",259
93,"3.5 Submission, Sympathy, Sovereignty
Each pole legitimizes themselves by appealing to a societally useful concept, and takes
it to an extreme as part of denouncing its opposite extreme.
The CCP is the most obvious: you must submit. They’re the Chinese Communist
Party, and they’re powerful, so you must bow your head. This is very simple and3.5. SUBMISSION, SYMPATHY, SOVEREIGNTY 155
straightforward and easy to understand, though it only really works for them within
China and the Chinese internet.
The NYT pole is slightly more subtle: they demand you must sympathize . After all
aren’t you white, or male, or straight, or cis, or abled, or wealthy, or a member of one
of an ever-multiplying number of privileged categories — and therefore an oppressor on
somedimension? Because you’repowerful, you must sympathize, and bow your head
to those you have ostensibly oppressed. It’s a left-handed version of the submission
ideology. It can get anyone to bow their head in the name of empowering them,
because 99.99% of the world is an “oppressor” on at least some dimension. This pole is
strongest on the English-speakinginternet, weakest on the Chinese internet, and of
intermediate strength outside that.
TheBTCpoleistheoppositeofbothofthese. Itdemandsyoumustbe sovereign . That
means rather than bending to the CCP, or slitting your wrists as NYT demands, you
hold your head up high. You hold your private keys locally, you don’t trust centralized
corporations or governments, you’re self-suﬃcient and autarkic, you’re living oﬀ the
grid. This pole is strong on the global internet, though it’s facing pushback from both
CCP and NYT.",428
94,"3.5.1 Extremes and Counter-Extremes Are Undesirable
The subtlety here is that each of these poles has an element of truth to it. You don’t
want a CCP society where everyone has no recourse but to submit, because that can
easily become a now-digital totalitarianism. On the other hand, you also don’t want a
society where no one submits to anyone, because that looks like San Francisco, where
people can run into Walgreens and steal everything.
You don’t want the NYT-run society where everyone has no recourse but to sympa-
thize with the current thing, because that results in what Matt Yglesias has called the
Great Awokening: the emotive and irrational breakdowns that set America on ﬁre and
continue to roil US society. Yet you also don’t want the society where no onesym-
pathizes, because that looks like the Grand Theft Auto environment of 1990s Russia,
the low-trust post-communist society where any cooperative endeavor is regarded as a
scam.
Finally, and perhaps least obviously, you don’t want the society where everyone must
be sovereign, because taken to its irrationallimit that means pumping your own156 CHAPTER 3. THE TRIPOLAR MOMENT
water from out of the ground, growing your own food, not trusting any vendor or
person other than yourself, and generally ending the division of labor that makes cap-
italism run. Extreme autarky might sound romantic, but in the absence of robotic
breakthroughs going truly oﬀ-grid is a recipe for dramatic regression in the standard of
living. Conversely, of course you don’t want a society where no one has the possibility
of being sovereign at all, as this leaves us all subject to the not-so-incipient digital
totalitarianism that CCP has already rolled out and NYT wishes it could.",426
95,"3.5.2 A Recentralized Center
One might argue —and Iwould agree— thatwhile these threepoles and theiropposite
three extremes are bad, they are not all equallybad, and you don’t necessarily need
to be dead center. For example, I’d personally err much closer to the sovereignty pole
than our current culture, and try to develop the technologies to enable this.
However, we should recognize that diﬀerent strokes will suit diﬀerent folks. And rather
than trying to impose preferences on everyone, what we really want are a varietyof
points in between these three undesirable poles: diﬀerent fusions for diﬀerent groups.
The construction we outline in this book — the startup society that ultimately becomes
a network state – ideally combines aspects of all three. For example, it does have a
clear founder to provide direction, but it ensures every citizen has the right to freely
leave should they choose, that coinholders also have a say, and a number of other digital
checks and balances. This concept is the basis of the recentralized center, an idea we
discuss in depth later.",253
96,"3.6 Conﬂicts and Alliances
A tripolar triangle leads to surprisingly complicated dynamics. During the Great De-
pression, FDR’s US admired the Nazis and the NYT wrote encomiums to them, as
documented in Three New Deals andThe Gray Lady Winked . Then, after the Molotov-
Ribbentrop Pact, the USSR and the Nazis kicked oﬀ World War 2 by invading Poland
together, with the USSR standing by as the Nazis fought the Anglo-Americans, and the
US-aligned UK seriously contemplating bombing the Soviets. Later, the USSR and the
Nazis fought each other during Barbarossa. Then, the US and the USSR teamed up
to ﬁght the Nazis. Finally, the US and USSR split Germany between themselves and
fought each other during the Cold War. That’s why Orwell wrote in 1984 about how
“Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia”— because the coalitions between3.6. CONFLICTS AND ALLIANCES 157
states switched all the time.
With networks rather than states, the coalitions are even more ﬂuid, with several
existing simultaneously.",259
97,"3.6.1 One Pole Against Another
NYT vs CCP. This is the obvious one, the Thucydides trap, the Great Power conﬂict
between the US and China that many have predicted. But there’s a subtlety here.
Many regular Chinese people don’t want such a conﬂict, and many Americans don’t
either, but those who are invested in imperial ambitions on both sides — the paper
subscribers and the party members — are into it. Networks are driving the states to
war.
NYT vs BTC. This is another obvious one, the American regulatory state (which NYT
is upstream of) against the decentralized network. We are seeing this push with eﬀorts
like the failed 2021 House Bill and the “concerned.tech” letter. Note the demographics
ofthesignatoriestothelatter: itisalmostentirelywhiteWesternerscomplainingabout
the US establishment losing root control over the global ﬁnancial system. It is doubtful
that their enthusiasm for the dollar will be shared by Americans hit by inﬂation — or
by people overseas. This conﬂict is the American establishment vs the Global Internet.
CCP vs BTC. Yet another obvious one. The CCP has “banned” Bitcoin many times
over the years, but those bans have materially grown in severity. The most recent
action was just short of a seizure.",315
98,"3.6.2 Two Poles vs the Third
NYT + CCP vs BTC. This is the State vs the Network. It’s when the NYT-controlled
American empire and the CCP-controlled Chinese empire team up to attack BTC,
perhaps on the grounds of “climate” or some other thinly veiled excuse to maintain
state power.
NYT + BTC vs CCP. This is Western voice and exit together vs Eastern control. It’s
whenNYT’sinterestsindisruptingtheChineseregimeandBTC’sinterestsinproviding
globally uncensorable savings overlap to provide a thorn in the side for CCP. The web3
part of BTC/web3 becomes particularly important here, because it provides hard-to-
censor global services that complement digital gold, which on its own is necessary but
not suﬃcient for freedom.
BTC + CCP vs NYT. This is the post-American world against the American empire.
Against the inﬂating dollar, China and crypto together can do something neither can
alone. The CCP/RMB pole runs a Chinese system that is already at scale, capable
of operating completely outside the dollar, and based on a more modern digital yuan158 CHAPTER 3. THE TRIPOLAR MOMENT
to boot. The BTC/web3 part of this aligns American dissidentswith global crypto
holders, and promotes neutral protocolsthat take away American root access (but
also don’t grant it to China).",326
99,"3.6.3 Intrapolar Conﬂicts
Near each pole there is an internal dyad representing the conﬂict within. We represent
this as an inscribed triangle within the tripolar triangle.
Near the NYT pole are the American dissidents, the non-woke liberals, centrists, and
conservatives who disagree with the US establishment’s platform of speech controls,
inﬂation, and unending warfare - but still identify as American ﬁrst, and don’t want
to see China become number one.
Near the CCP pole are the Chinese liberals, the internationalist capitalists who thought
times were better under Hu, as well as the many groups left and right who’ve seen their
fortunes dim under newly aggressive Chinese nationalism...but, again, who still see
themselves as Chinese ﬁrst, and don’t want to bend to American imperialism.
Near the BTC pole is the web3 community and the tens of millions of Bitcoin holders
who don’t identify as Maximalists...but who also still subscribe to many of the inter-
nationalist principles that presuppose an internet without American orChinese root
control over the ﬁnancial or communication systems.",268
100,"3.6.4 The Road To Recentralization
And what about other countries and people who don’t deﬁne themselves with reference
to the Americans, the Chinese, or the blockchain? Well, there will be a lot of pressure
to identify with the ﬁrst two poles...which will drive any group that doesn’t want to be
under the thumb of the US establishment or the CCP to the third pole of BTC/web3.
That is, one of our premises is that the Indians, Israelis, American dissidents, Chinese
liberals, techfounders/investors, andpeoplefromothercountriesthatwantto maintain
their own sovereignty will need to avail themselves of BTC/web3 for decentralized
communication, transaction, and computation.
But to fully explain why, we’ll need to go through a scenario for the future that isn’t
about remaining under the thumb of US or Chinese centralization, nor about falling
into crypto-anarchic decentralization, but rather about consciously recentralizing into
opt-in startup societies.",231
101,"4.1 The Possible Futures
It’s not about thefuture, it’s about the possiblefutures.
Why? Because causality exists. Because we can run controlled experiments. Because
human action can inﬂuence outcomes. Because we aren’t communists that believe
in the historical inevitability of utopian outcomes, but technologists that believe in
individual initiative subject to practical constraints.
The previous two chapters were about those constraints, about the past and the im-
mediate present. They orient us to discuss several possible futures, before picking out
one trajectory to focus on - the one where we materialize many startup societies, get a
few diplomatically recognized as network states, and rebuild high-trust societies via a
recentralized center.
Some caveats before we begin, though.
When it comes to the past, every history is, inevitably, just a story.That is, any
tale of the past is necessarily abridged, abbreviated, edited, and idiosyncratic. You
can’t convey 5000 years of written records any other way. And our tale of History
as Trajectory is no diﬀerent: it’s like the “why now” slide at the beginning of every
entrepreneur’s deck, a practical historyof particular events that lead to the feasibility
159160 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
of the network state. But we cited our references, so you can check our facts.
On the topic of the present, our chapter on the Tripolar Moment is the section of the
book that is likely to be the most dated. Intentionally so, because we endeavored to
move most references to current or near-past events to this section.So, think of that
chapter as being very much a worldview circa mid-2022; like the Kalman ﬁlter, we
reserve the right to incorporate new information to update it.
Now to the subject of the future. As you’ll see we do believe a recentralized center
of pragmatic network states canemerge, and describe several scenarios where this
could happen. But our projections are just scenarios, and throughout we keep in mind
volatility, reﬂexivity, competing curves, and the consequent limits to predictability.
First,volatility is rising because the internet increases variance. Social media is social
volatility (go viral or get canceled), and cryptocurrency is ﬁnancial volatility (go to
the moon or get rekt). Volatility makes correct predictions more diﬃcult, but oﬀers
upside for those who predict correctly. And volatility is good for insurgents and bad
for incumbents, because the former only need to get lucky once while the latter need
to keep staying lucky. It’s no longer just individuals that are subject to high volatility,
as entire countries can rise and fall overnight. So, in a high volatility environment,
only Bezos-style invariants remain constant. All other observations should be taken as
tentative — they are true until they are suddenly not.
Reﬂexivity is Soros’ term for the feedback loop between participants’ understanding
of a situation and the situation in which they participate. In systems made of human
beings, putting something out into the world results in a reaction, and then a reaction
to that reaction, and so on, often resulting in positive and negative feedback loops
rather than textbook convergence to equilibria. Thus, when collecting data on such
systems, let alone forecasting them, one must keep in mind that people will reactto
predictions themselves, sometimes to make them come true. In social science, unlike
physical science, every row in a dataset represents a human being with a mind of their
own.
The concept of competing curves refers to the fact that there are many simultaneous
technopolitical movements competing at the present moment, diﬀerent phenomena ris-
ing from zero to aﬀect millions over the course of years, months, or even days. For
example, if you take a look at this graph of how people met their spouses, you can see
several diﬀerent curves rising and falling as diﬀerent cultural movements “come online,”4.1. THE POSSIBLE FUTURES 161
until the internet just dominates everything. Another example is the market share of
social networks over time; a third is Ray Dalio’s graph of the rise and fall of nations.
Thepointisthatyoucanidentifytheplayers, butnotalwaystheoutcome, inacomplex
multiactor process. Applying this to our scenario analysis, we have some trends that
are synergistic and others that are antagonistic. For example, many trendlines point to
diminished American power, but at least one points in the other direction: the West’s
willingness to weaponize its tech giants for domestic and foreign conﬂicts alike. Does
this give American dominance another few years, another decade, or many more than
that? We can identify the curves but not always which ones win out.
Predictability has its limits. In our view there are two kinds of predictions that matter:
the physical and the ﬁnancial. The physical prediction is a very speciﬁc bet on the
trajectory of a ball, on a genomic base call, or on the electron conﬁguration of an
orbital. It’s checked by reproducible experiment, and your device fails if it fails. The
ﬁnancial prediction is at the opposite end of the spectrum: it’s a macroscopic bet on
the volatile, reﬂexive behavior of other human beings. It’s checked by the unforgiving
market, and your fund fails if it fails.
We aren’t as interested in betting on manipulation-prone government statistics. Ac-
cording to the Chinese government of 2021, the number of COVID deaths in China
from mid 2020-2022 was zero. According to the San Francisco government of 2021,
the crime rate in SF was declining. According to the US establishment of 2021, the
inﬂation of the dollar was transitory. All this reminds us of the Soviet government of
1932, who said the harvest in Ukraine was glorious.
As we discuss later, it isuseful to create on-chain shadow statistics that are more
veriﬁable, reliable, and censorship-resistant than these easily faked indicators. But
outside of that, predictions on oﬃcial government statistics are otherwise uninteresting
because of how obviously political they are. So we steer clear of that kind of thing
— in our analysis of possible futures, we’ll either predict something is technologically
(and hence physically) feasible, or that it could result in a ﬁnancial return, or both.
And we’ll give recipes for how to make those predictions reality, or prevent them from
becoming reality, in the form of ﬁctional scenarios on good and bad futures.
So, to recap: our history is just a story, our analysis of the present may presently
be dated, and our forecasts for the future may be confounded by volatility, reﬂexivity,
competingcurves, andthelimitsofpredictability. Withthatsaid, allmodelsarewrong,
but some are useful; so with caveats cataloged and provisos provided, let’s proceed!",1631
102,"4.1.1 Analytical Axes and Scenario Analyses
We start by describing new lenses to view the world in the sections on Sociopolitical
andTechnoeconomic axes. These are mental models that hopefully help compress large
amounts of data into rough patterns.
Next, in the section on Foreseeable Futures , we put on our tech investor hats and162 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
project out into the near future, describing developments we anticipate. These aren’t
just random investment theses, though; they’re pieces of the future that are relevant
to startup societies and network states.
We then game out one speciﬁc science ﬁction scenario in detail that we think is unfor-
tunately quite plausible: American Anarchy, Chinese Control, and the International
Intermediate . In this scenario, we project a Second American Civil War triggered in
part by a broke US government that attempts Bitcoin seizures, a situation we call
American Anarchy. Unlike the ﬁrst Civil War, this would be a stochastic struggle be-
tween two Networks rather than an explicit dispute between two States. It would be
more undeclared than declared, more invisible than legible. And this conﬂict could end
in decentralization and disunion instead of centralization and consolidation. As radical
as that sounds, many thinkers from across the political spectrum already foresee some-
thing like this happening in diﬀerent ways, including Stephen Marche, David Reaboi,
Barbara Walter, and Kurt Schlichter, though like me none of them are particularly
happy about the prospect.
Meanwhile, in this ﬁctional scenario, the CCP implements an intense domestic crack-
down on the other side of the world to maintain stability, preventing Chinese people
from freely leaving the digital yuan network with their property, a result we refer
to as Chinese Control. As America descends into anarchy, the CCP points to their
functional-but-highly-unfree system as the only alternative, and exports a turnkey ver-
sion of their surveillance state to other countries as the next version of Belt and Road,
as a piece of “infrastructure” that comes complete with a SaaS subscription to China’s
all-seeing AI eye.
In the name of putting a lid on the anarchy and restoring “democracy”, the US es-
tablishment then silently copies CCP’s methodology without admitting they’re doing
so, much as they cloned China’s lockdown after loudly denouncing it. Similarly, after
spending a decade pretending to decry “surveillance capitalism”, the US establishment
formally deputizes many Big Tech companies as oﬃcial arms of the surveillance state.
However, the establishment’s implementation of this digital lockdown is as tragicomic
as the CCP’s version is totalitarian, and is porous enough to permit serious resistance.",644
103,"4.1.2 Strong Form and Weak Form Models of the Future
This is the world we could be barreling towards. You don’t have to believe in it to
found a startup society, though. So why talk about it at all then? Because in a high
volatility time, it’s worth thinking through models of how our future could be very
diﬀerent from our present.4.1. THE POSSIBLE FUTURES 163
Think of the American-Anarchy-vs-Chinese-Control scenario as a strong form model
of how NYT, BTC, and CCP could collide, with startup societies and network states
arising out of that atom-smasher as deliberately created alternatives to Wokeness,
Maximalism, andChinese Communism.
The weak form model is that things don’t work out precisely this way (few things do!),
but that the general trend is correct. That is, in the future the US Establishment
doeslose relative control, the CCP doestry to exert absolute control, and Bitcoin
Maximalists doadvocate for no control. The way of life propounded by each of these
ideological communities will get extreme, but will also be itself justiﬁed as a reaction
to the other two perceived extremes, as discussed in Extremes and Counter-Extremes
Are Undesirable . So we’ll still need to build societies with consciously chosen tradeoﬀs
between submission, sympathy, and sovereignty, instead of unconsciously capitulating
to either an extreme or counter-extreme. And that again leads us to startup societies
and network states.
So, using the strong-form scenario as a base, we discuss a number of Victory Conditions
and Surprise Endings fordiﬀerentfactions. Wealsogiveabitmoredetailonthedesired
outcome, the trajectory we want to shoot for: a Recentralized Center of high-trust
societies.",423
104,"4.1.3 Building the Future Rather than Defaulting Into It
Our goal in thinking all this through is not pessimistic but pragmatic: to change
what we can change, by setting up a fourth pole as an alternative to the failing US
establishment, to maximalist crypto-anarchy, andto the centralized surveillance state
of the CCP.
We call the raw material for this fourth pole the International Intermediate . It in-
cludes American centrists, Chinese liberals, Indians, Israelis, web3 technologists, and
essentially everyone from around the world that wants to avoid both the American and
Chinese whirlpools.
At ﬁrst blush, this group represents ~80% of the world population and has little in
common save their disinclination towards both anarchy and tyranny. But a subset of
them will be smart enough to realize that exit is a stopgap, not a solution. People tend
to imitate what they see, and if American Anarchy and Chinese Control are the most
prominent games in town they will eventually be imitated.
So isolationism is oﬀ the table. Yet so is direct intervention, as both the American and
Chinese theaters will snarl against any outside interference.
The answer then is innovation rather than isolationism or interventionism. A subset164 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
of the International Intermediate needs to build something better than both American
Anarchy and Chinese Control, a concrete improvement over the propaganda, coercion,
surveillance, and conﬂict that may soon characterize the two pillars of the global econ-
omy.
In other words, the rest of the world will need to lead. They can’t hope for the US
establishment or CCP to ﬁgure it out. And that’s the Recentralized Center : a circle of
startup societies and network states built by pragmatic founders, a group of high-trust
communities architected as intentional alternatives to failed states and surveillance
states alike.",430
105,"4.2 Sociopolitical Axes
Old mental models for understanding the world are quickly going out of date. Not
only are things changing faster, things are changing faster on new dimensions . New
sociopolitical axes are emerging. Seeing the world through old lenses risks being caught
blindsided by the political equivalent of a runaway truck. People who thought the
ﬁnancialcrisisof2008wasunthinkablejustweren’tlookingattherightgraphs. Michael
Burry was, though.
In the same spirit, what are some new graphs we could look at, new themes for conﬂict
and cooperation, new sociopolitical axes that are underestimated? That’s what this
section is about.",155
106,"4.2.1 International Indians
I am moderately bullish on India, but extremely bullish on Indians.
Why? Well, ﬁrst let’s talk about India the country. If you’re in the West, haven’t
been paying attention to India, and think it’s still just an uninteresting “Third World
country,” you can be forgiven for that. But take a look at the following links to orient:
•Here is a visual comparison of parts of Los Angeles vs India.
•Here’s a graph showing hundreds of millions of Indians getting cheap mobile
internet service over the last ﬁve few years
•Here’s an amazing economic survey of India showing growth over the last decade
•Here’s a chart showing India is now #3 in tech unicorns after the US and China.
•Here’s a post that discusses the overall picture: The Internet Country
Putting that all together, there are now signiﬁcant chunks of the “ascending world”
which are cleaner and better maintained than the “descending world” environments of
Los Angeles and San Francisco. That doesn’t mean the curves are the same — just
that they overlap in a way that would have been unthinkable a few decades ago.4.2. SOCIOPOLITICAL AXES 165
Next, let’s talk about the Indian diaspora. There are about ﬁve million people of Indian
ancestryintheUS,UK,Canada, andAustralia, andafairbitmoreifweincludethefull
South Asian diaspora. They have done quite well over the last few decades. While the
ﬁrst generation came over with portable technical skills in medicine and engineering,
the second generation within the West speaks English without an accent and with
full cultural ﬂuency - resulting in many Indians in law, ﬁlmmaking, and media. Some
have even ascended to the commanding heights of politics and technology, like Kamala
Harris, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella.
That sets up an interesting State-plus-Network dynamic. Using our terminology, the
IndianStatemay take one step back for every two steps forward, even though it’s been
moving forward as of late. But the Network of the global Indian diaspora is just on
an exponential rise. Indeed, I think the 2020s will be for the Indian Network what the
2010s were for the Chinese State - somewhat ignored at the beginning of the decade,
but an important global force by the end of it.
Recall that “China had its ﬁrst unicorn in 2010, and it took ﬁve years for it to get to
ﬁve unicorns; the year after that, it had twenty. Ecosystems develop very slowly, and
then all at once.”
Please don’t think of this as Indian triumphalism at all – I actually ﬁnd it surprising!
It’s just recognition of an unexpected new player entering the arena that many still
underappreciate. For further context, you might read A New Idea of India orOur Time

107,"4.2.2 Transhumanism Versus Anarcho-Primitivism
An important emerging political axis is transhumanism versus anarcho-primitivism.
Brieﬂy, transhumanists think technology is good, and want to use technology to change
humanity in fundamental ways. Conversely, anarcho-primitivists think technology is
bad, and want to to return to the wild, de-industrialize, and abandon technology. They
think of humans as pollution on this great Earth.
There are right and left varieties of each, though they overlap. Left transhumanists like
Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum to some extent give rise to right anarcho-
primitivists, and vice versa. Basically, left transhumanists make changes to the human
body that rightists ﬁnd aesthetically unappealing. Conversely, right transhumanists
advocateimprovementstothehumanbodythatleftanarcho-primitivistsﬁndterrifying.
It works in reverse as well. Some anarcho-primitivists advocate a back-to-the-land
kind of traditional masculinity that some transhumanists ﬁnd constraining. And some
anarcho-primitivists want a Unabomber-like end to industrial civilization which would
(among other things!) destroy the supply chains needed for the life extension sought
by transhumanists.166 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION",321
108,"4.2.3 The Identity Stack
An issue that confused me for a while is why criticism of San Francisco seemed to anger
some people irrationally. Couldn’t they also see that prices and feces were both up and
to the right at the same time? Eventually what I realized is that everyone is patriotic
aboutsomething , and those people were patriotic about their city, while others were
patriotic about their countries, companies, or even their cryptocurrencies.
To elaborate on this point, for someone who identiﬁes themselves as a San Franciscan,
criticism of the city is taken personally, because that isn’t a swappable piece of their
life. Their company? That’s just a job, it’s replaceable, what they really care about is
the Golden Gate Bridge, the Presidio, the 49ers - a sort of romantic identiﬁcation with
the city itself, and many of the people that live there.
Others aﬃliate with their national identity ﬁrst, above their city identity - they’ll move
between military bases at the drop of a hat, which are interchangeable, but they are
willing to kill and die for the ﬂag with which they identify. Or they might be “based”
out of Seattle for a time, signifying that their location is immaterial, while signaling
their deep love for democracy online, an identity that is non-negotiable.
Still others are patriotic about their companies, those things they’ve founded and
funded, breathed life into, those entities that took all their capital and intellect to
build, which are always far more fragile than they look from the outside, and which
some callous outsider could break for likes with a few morale-draining tweets.
And yet others characterize themselves by their cryptocurrencies, thinking of them-
selves ﬁrst and foremost as Bitcoiners or Ethereans. These folks are often digital
nomads, indiﬀerent as to whether they see the sunset in San Francisco or Singapore, or
what crypto exchange lives or dies, so long as they can check in with their community
of holders each day.
In each case, there’s typically a large economic, social, or political stake in the thing
people are identifying with. The city patriot may be a homeowner or otherwise invested
in city governance. The country patriot may have signed a military contract. The
company patriot may be a founder or early employee with a signiﬁcant equity stake.
And the cryptocurrency patriot is often a sizeable holder of coins.
Now, not all things are like this; people can be right-handed without identifying them-
selves as right handers, they can do something without being something. So top-level
identity, primary identity - that’s precious, it’s rare, it’s the identity that supersedes all
others. People might use seven daily apps but they have even fewer primary identities
- usually only one.
Primary identities need not just be about city, country, company, or cryptocurrency.
Theycanberelatedtoreligion, ethnicity, orprofessionslike“journalist” and“professor”.
There’s a huge up-front sacriﬁce required to become a tenured professor, or to publicly
convert to a new religion, and for this reason such primary identities often make it to
the fore of someone’s Twitter bio.4.3. TECHNOECONOMIC AXES 167
Example: Twitter Bios
Here’s a concrete example of the identity stack, with three Twitter bios:
•Jim: #HereWeGo #SteelerNation — All Things PA — Father — Husband —
#Christian — #ArmyVet
•Billy: Immutable money, inﬁnite frontier, eternal life. #Bitcoin
•Bob: Army retired, anti-terrorist assistance program, husband, father, grandfa-
ther, Iraq vet, educator, but most importantly an AMERICAN!
Again, everybody is patriotic about something. Jim loves his city; Billy is patriotic
about technology and transhumanism; Bob would ﬁght for the American ﬂag.
The collection of all that deﬁnes someone, in rank order, is their identity stack . The top
of the identity stack is the primary identity: the Pittsburgh Steelers for Jim, Bitcoin
for Billy, and America for Bob.
And, as noted, primary identity is precious. It’s the identity that supersedes all others.
To build anything great – a company, a currency, a civilization – an aﬃliation must
beat out the rest of the identity stack to become someone’s primary identity. That’s a
high bar to meet.",1051

110,"4.3.1 The Internet Increases Variance
The internet increases variance. Digitization allows situations to be taken to their
logical conclusion, instantly, even when that digital logic doesn’t quite work in physical
reality. This means things can ﬂip from zero to one, without warning. An overnight
success, ten seconds in the making. The only certainty is rising volatility.168 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
First, the observation: over the last 20 years, we’ve gone from 30 minute sitcoms to
30 second clips and 30 episode Netﬂix binges. From a stable 9-5 job to a gig economy
task or a crypto windfall. From a standard life script to 30 year olds living with their
parents and 20 year old startup CEOs.
This is a very general phenomenon. You see it in the dashboard of every internet
disruptor. With Uber, for example, relative to the time of a standard taxi ride, some
Uber trips are much longer and others much shorter.
Why is this happening? Because the internet connects people peer-to-peer. It disinter-
mediates. In doing this it removes the middleman, the mediator, the moderator, and
the mediocrity. Of course, each of those words has a diﬀerent connotation. People are
happy to see the middleman and mediocrity go, but they don’t necessarily want to see
the moderator and mediator disappear.
Nevertheless, at least at ﬁrst, when the internet enters an arena, once the Network
Leviathan rears its head, this is what happens. Nodes that had never met before,
could never have met before, now connect peer-to-peer. They can form something
terrible like a Twitter mob, or they can form something amazing like ETH Research.
You get extreme downside and extreme upside.
One analogy is to a centrifuge. If you take a sample of biological ﬂuid from your body
andcentrifugeit, you’llseeabunchoflayersthatwerepreviouslymixedtogether. Then
they all get separated out. That’s what the internet is doing to society, to institutions.
It’s just centrifuging it into its constituent parts, whether that be albums separated
into songs or newspapers disaggregated into articles.
That’s the unbundling. Then comes the rebundling. The songs get grouped into
playlists, the articles grouped into Twitter feeds. This step too is proﬁtable; it’s not
the same as what came before, it’s a v3, it’s a ﬂexible bundle. It’s the helical theory of
history, where from one standpoint we’ve come full circle (“rebundling into an album-
like playlist”) but from another axis we’ve made amazing progress (“anyone can play
any individual song and create whatever playlist they want”).
With that said, that rebundling is still higher variance than the pre-internet bundles
that preceded them. There are millions more playlists than albums, millions more
Twitter feeds than newspapers.
BlueAnon, QAnon, SatoshiAnon
Astheinternetincreasesvariance, weseemoreupsideandmoredownsideineverything.
Technologists focus on the upside, because the gain from the wins (like search engines,
smartphones, social networks, and artiﬁcial intelligence) should compound while the
losses should be one-oﬀs. That is, once you ﬁnd a winning formula, or a rebundling, you4.3. TECHNOECONOMIC AXES 169
can cheaply scale it across the rest of the network relatively quickly. So, this probably
should lead to more netupside over time, just like every past technological revolution
has. I think we’re already way in the black with the internet (almost every piece of
information ever in billions of people’s hands for free at any time, for starters), but it
depends on your metric.
Conversely, the establishment can only see the downside outcomes. That is, the
BlueAnons can only see the QAnons who are worse than median, not the Satoshi-
Anons who are far better than median. It’s a bit like Paul Graham’s concept of the
Blub programmer. Just like the Blub programmer can look down to see incompe-
tence, but can’t look up to see brilliance, the establishmentarian can’t comprehend the
upwards deviations of the internet. They think it’s just weird.
JustlikeHollywoodoncecomparedNetﬂixtotheAlbanianArmy, theUSestablishment
doesn’t yet understand how much better Satoshi Nakamoto or Vitalik Buterin is than
every apparatchik they have in the Federal Reserve system. And they don’t understand
that upward deviation is creating a more competent group of global leaders than the
American establishment, a more meritocratically selected group than the nepotists of
the East Coast.
Just as it allowed Satoshi to rise.
Social Media is American Glasnost, Cryptocurrency is American Pere-
stroika
There are two particular ways that the internet increases variance worth noting: social
media and digital currency.
•Social media increases social volatility . You can go viral or get canceled, experi-
encing large overnight gainsor losses in status.
•Digital currency increases ﬁnancial volatility . You can go to the moon or “get
rekt,” experiencing large overnight gains or losses in ﬁnancial status.
There’s a parallel in history for this: glasnost and perestroika. Mikhail Gorbachev, the
last Soviet leader, thought he could reform Soviet society by allowing more free speech
(via glasnost) and free markets (via perestroika). He didn’t quite understand what he
was in for. The resultant instability helped bring down the Soviet Union.
Similarly, social media is like American glasnost and cryptocurrency is American per-
estroika. Just as Gorbachev unleashed free speech and free market reforms because he
believed communism could be reformed, the US establishment actually bought their
own narrative in the 1990s and 2000s about their ostensibly free and democratic soci-
ety. Only now are they realizing that the many speech and thought controls that their
predecessors had set up and hidden in plain sight - like stringent regulations and high170 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
capital requirements for broadcast content production - was actually the key to their
continued power.
Now that it’s clear that the Internet is to the USA what the USA was to the USSR, that
it’s truly free speech and free markets, they are trying to tamp down the American
Spring they’ve unleashed, but it may be too late. Obama was in a sense arguably
America’s Gorbachev, as he allowed technology to grow mostly unimpeded from 2008-
2016, to billions of users, without fully realizing what would ensue.
The 100-Year Information Tsunami
Few institutions that predated the internet will survive the internet.
Why? Because the internet increases variance, it causes huge surges of digital pressure
on older institutions that just weren’t built for it. They can’t handle the peak levels
of social and ﬁnancial stress that the internet can unleash. They’re like seaside towns
that weren’t built for a thousand year ﬂood. Michael Solana’s post JUMPis quite good
on this topic.
Indeed, this is a good analogy, because one of the ways to think about the internet is as
a carrier of massive information waves . Most normal waves propagate in physical space
–– the standard partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) are 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional (e.g.
longitudinal waves like a slinky, transverse like electromagnetic waves, or earthquake-
stylesphericalwaves). But theseinformationwaves propagateonhighlydynamicsocial
networks where the topologyof connection & disconnection changes quite a bit.",1818
111,"4.3.2 Naturally Physical to Natively Digital
The digital is primary and the physical is now secondary.
Three Phase Transition
The digital transition happens in three phases: there’s the physical version, the inter-
mediate form, and then the internet-native version. If you’re into electrical engineering,
you can think of this as analog, to analog/digital, to natively digital.
•One example is the transition from a piece of paper, to a scanner which scans
that ﬁle into a digital version, to a natively digital text ﬁle which begins life on
the computer and is only printed out when it needs to be.
•Another example is the transition from face-to-face meetings, to Zoom video
(which is a scanner of faces), to natively digital VR meetings.
•Yet another example: physical cash, to something like PayPal or ﬁntech (which is
just a scan of the pre-existing banking system), to the truly native digital version
of money: cryptocurrency.4.3. TECHNOECONOMIC AXES 171
Once you see this pattern you can see it everywhere, and you can look for those spaces
where we’re still stuck at the v2, at the scanned version, where we’ve taken the oﬄine
experience and put it online, but not fundamentally innovated.
Truly Digital News: Dashboards, On-Chain Event Feeds
Newspapers are actually only partially digitized. In 1996, the primary version of The
New York Times was the physical paper and the mirror was the website. Then, grad-
ually, more and more weight got shifted to the digital version. Now it can fairly be
said that the physical paper is just a printout of the website, a snapshot at a particular
time. And there are online-only features like interactive graphics that are impossible
to replicate in the physical paper. Most importantly, the comments section is really
social media, particularly Twitter, where all the reporters are located.
But this is still really just a newspaper, put online. Most of it canbe printed out.
What’s the next step in this evolution? What does natively digital news look like?
There are at least two concepts of interest here: morning dashboards replacing the
morning newspaper, and cryptographically veriﬁable event feeds replacing tweets of
unveriﬁable content.
Dashboards > newspapers. If you are in tech, the ﬁrst thing you look at each day
may be a personal or company dashboard, like your ﬁtbit or your sales. This is good.
The ﬁrst thing you look at each day shouldn’t be random stories someone else picked.
Should be carefully selected metrics you want to improve. This is a good vector of
attack to deﬁnitionally disrupt newspapers.
If we think about it from Clayton Christensen’s “jobs to be done” perspective, news-
papers have this incredible pride-of-place — ﬁrst thing you look at in the morning! —
but typically do not add enough value to deserve that position.
On-chain event feeds > Twitter > newspapers. Onekeyobservationisthatjustasmany
sports articles are digest of box scores, and many ﬁnancial articles are summaries of the
day’s stock action, so too are many political and tech articles merely wrappers around
tweets.
Because news breaks on Twitter. So, eventually, the next kind of newspaper will look
something like a cryptographically veriﬁed version of Twitter. The ﬁrst draft of history
will be the raw on-chain event feed, written directly to the ledger of record by billions
of writers and sensors around the world.
In other words, truly digital newspapers will be on-chain event feeds. Digitally signed
crypto oracles, not corporations.
Remote Work to Remote Life
My friend Daniel Gross remarked that 2020 will be seen by future historians as the
year when the internet age truly began.172 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
The lasting impact of COVID-19 is that it ﬂipped the world from physical to digital
ﬁrst. Because the internet in 2000 or 2010 couldn’t bear the load of the entire physical
world. But by 2020, it kind of could. Now it’s not just about remote work, but remote
life.
During the pandemic, every sector that had previously been socially resistant to the
internet (healthcare, education, law, ﬁnance, government itself) capitulated. Those
aspects of society that had been very gradually changing with technology shifted
overnight. For example, the convention of politeness shifted: now it was rude to ask
for an in-person business meeting, as you’d do it remote if at all possible.
With vaccination, many of these things have ﬂipped back, but they won’t come back
all the way. Digitization was permanently accelerated.
It used to be that the physical world was primary, and the internet was the mirror.
Now that has ﬂipped. The digital world is primary and the physical world is just the
mirror. We’re still physical beings, of course. But important events happen on the
internet ﬁrst and then materialize in the physical world later, if ever.
From Printing to Materializing
All value eventually becomes digital, because we are generalizing the concept of “print-
ing” from inking a piece of paper to actually materializing digital things in the physical
world. This is counterintuitive, and you’ll have objections. But let’s get there in a few
steps.
1.Much value creation is already digital. If you’re reading this, you’re probably
an information worker. You may not have thought about it this way, but the
majorityofyourwakinghoursareprobablyspentinfrontofonescreenoranother
— a laptop for work, a phone on the go, a tablet for reading, and so on. So,
most of your life is alreadyspent in the Matrix, in a sense, even before the
advent of widespread AR/VR. Short of a pullback to an Amish or Andaman
Islander existence, most of your life is and will be digitally inﬂuenced in some
form. Moreover, much of the value in the physical world comes from blueprints
created on a computer in some form; eg, the iPhones manufactured in Shenzhen
gain much of their value from the designers in California. So, a good fraction of
valuecreation is largely digital.
2.More value creation is becoming digital. Read Packy McCormick’s article on
“The Great Online Game,” and think about every information worker essentially
pressing buttons to earn cryptocurrency in a giant globalized internet economy.
That’s what 2030 or 2035 is on track to look like.
3.Much spending is already digital. Think about what fraction of your spending
already goes to digital goods like books, music, software-as-a-service, and the
like. Now think about what fraction of the remainder goes through a digital
interface of some kind, whether through an ecommerce website like Amazon or a4.3. TECHNOECONOMIC AXES 173
point-of-sale terminal via Apple Pay. So, it’s already fairly uncommon for people
in industrialized societies to do a fully oﬄine purely physical transaction, which
might be conceptualized as “hand a ﬁve dollar bill over at a farmer’s market for
several tomatos.”
4.Many actions can be analogized to printing. Now take this one step further and
thinkabouttheremainingoﬄinecomponentsas“printing” somethingout, though

complicated multijurisdictional delivery process ensues, resulting in a box landing
at your front door. You hit a button on Uber and a car arrives. You hit a button
on Doordash and food arrives. You hit a button to rent an Airbnb, and then
another to open the smart lock, and the door to housing opens. You can do the
same for the door to your coworking space oﬃce, or the door to your electric car.
So, more and more of the goods people prize in the physical world are in a sense
“printed” out.
5.Many printing actions can be fully automated. Today, there’s a human in the loop
forthingslikefooddelivery. Butasroboticsimproves, thiscouldintheorybecome
a completely electromechanical process, just like printing. Every individual step
from the farm to table could be automated. As this visual shows, there are
already robots for each step: robots in the fertilizer factories, for harvesting, and",1980
112,"for last-mile delivery. As an exercise, it’d be useful to a full stack example where
someone “prints” out an apple and it’s fully robotically grown and delivered, even
if in practice you’d have stockpiles of apples rather than (slowly!) growing them
on demand.
So, if you put all that together, all value is digital. Everything starts on the computer,
generates cryptocurrency, and can be used either to buy digital goods or to pay robots
to materialize things in the physical world.
Humans will still exist, of course, but the economy will become the cryptoeconomy.
All value goes digital.",145
113,"4.3.3 The Productivity Mystery
What is the productivity mystery? Well, we really should be in the middle of a golden
age of productivity. Within living memory, computers did not exist. Photocopiers did
not exist. Even backspace did not exist. You had to type it all by hand.
It wasn’t that long ago that you couldn’t search all your documents, sort them, back
them up, look things up, copy/paste things, email things, change fonts of things, or
undo things. Instead, you had to type it all on a typewriter!
If you’re doing information work, relative to your ancestors who worked with papyrus,
paper, or typewriter, you are a golden god surﬁng on a sea of electrons. You can make
things happen in seconds that would have taken them weeks, if they could do them at
all.174 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
We should also be far more productive in the physical world. After all, our predeces-
sors built railroads, skyscrapers, airplanes, and automobiles without computers or the
internet. And built them fast. Using just typewriters, slide rules, & safety margins.
This is a corollary to the Thiel/Cowen/Hall concept of the Great Stagnation. Where
has all that extra productivity gone? It doesn’t appear manifest in the physical world,
for sure, though you can argue it is there in the internet world. There are a few possible
theses.
1.The Great Distraction. All the productivity we gained has been frittered away
on equal-and-opposite distractions like social media and games.
2.The Great Dissipation. The productivity has been dissipated on things like forms,
compliance, and process.
3.The Great Divergence. The productivity is here, it’s just only harnessed by the
indistractable few. The founders of tech unicorns, for example, may have more
ability to focus online than most.
4.The Great Dilemma. The productivity has been burned in bizarre ways that
require line-by-line “proﬁling” of everything, like this tunnel study.
5.The Great Dumbness. The productivity is here, but we’ve just made dumb deci-
sions in the West while others have harnessed it. See for example China building
a train station in nine hours vs taking 100-1000Xthat long to upgrade a Cal-
train stop. Now, yes, I’m sure not every train station in China is built in nine
hours, and wouldn’t be surprised if some regions in the US (or the West more
broadly) do better than SFBA. But feels likely that a systematic study would
ﬁnd a qualitative speed gap, 10-100X or more.
6.The Great Delay. The productivity will be here, but is delayed till the arrival of
robotics. That is, for things we can do completely on the computer, productivity
has measurably accelerated. It is 100X faster to email something than to mail
it. But a slow human still needs to act on it. So, in this hypothesis, humans are
now the limiting factor.
Essentially, representing a complex project on disk in something like Google Docs
may not be the productivity win we think it is. Humans still need to comprehend
all those electronic documents to build the thing in real life.
So the problem may be in the analog/digital interface. Do we need to actuate
as fast as we compute? That would mean zero-delay robotic task completion
will be the true productivity unlock. And that we haven’t gone full digital yet.
So long as humans are still in the loop, we won’t get the full beneﬁts of digital
productivity.4.3. TECHNOECONOMIC AXES 175
I don’t know the answer, but I think the line-by-line proﬁling approach used on the
tunnels is a good but slow way to ﬁnd out exactly what went wrong, while the approach
of looking at other countries and time periods – namely, studying history – could
actually be the fast way of ﬁguring out what might be right.",949
114,"4.3.4 Linguistic Borders of the Internet
If the organic borders of the physical world are rivers and mountain ranges, the organic
borders of the internet are software incompatibilities and language barriers.
The ﬁrst of these is obvious: Facebook’s ecosystem is distinct from Google’s is distinct
from Ethereum’s, because the backends don’t fully overlap, because they’re incompat-
ible at the software level.
The second is a bit less obvious. You can imagine the internet being cut up into
continental-scale pieces, with the English-language internet being the largest with bil-
lions of people, the Chinese-language internet being the second largest with 1.3 billion,
and so on for the Spanish-language, Japanese-language, Korean-language, Russian-
language internets.
One huge diﬀerence between the English internet and Chinese internet is that the
former is global and arguably decentralized while the latter is heavily concentrated in
China with the CCP maintaining root control over most key nodes.
Another important consequence is that the English internet is about to admit a billion
new users in the form of all the Indians who are newly coming online. And because the
Indian internet becomes a much bigger part of the English-language discourse, it will
be diﬃcult for the US establishment to censor the English-language internet as much
as they want to, because hosting can be based in the sovereign country of India.",319
115,"4.3.5 Network Defects
A network defect is when increasing the size beyond a certain point decreases the value
ofthenetwork. Metcalfe’slawdoesn’tincludethisdynamicasutilityisprojectedtojust
increase to inﬁnity as network size grows, but there are a few diﬀerent mathematical
models that predict this outcome, such as congestion-based models or this post by
Vitalik.
Repulsion within a network is a key dynamic that can lead to network defect. The idea
is that two or more subgroups within a network have such conﬂict that it reduces the
global value of the network for both, until one of them defects to another network. So
it’s a network “defect” in both senses of the term: a failure and a political defection.176 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION",207

117,"4.4.1 AR Glasses Bridge Physical and Digital Worlds
Augmented reality (AR) glasses may be the most foreseeable invention of all time.
In the 90s and 2000s, people talked about the convergence device . Gates imagined it
would be a smart television, but it turned out to be the iPhone. What’s the next
convergence device? I think it’s AR glasses. Take the following technologies:
•Snapchat’s Spectacles
•Facebook’s Oculus Quest
•Google Glass Enterprise
•Apple’s AR Kit
•Augmented reality apps like Pokemon Go
If you put all those together, you get a vision of augmented reality glasses that give
you instant-on access to the digital world in your ﬁeld of view, and perhaps darken
with another touch to give you virtualreality. Anyone can teleport into or out of your
ﬁeld of vision with your consent, you can “right click” on any object to get AI-informed
metadata on it, and you can get computer-guided instructions to execute almost any
physical procedure from repairing a machine to sewing.
We know that millions of people manage to wear glasses all day, and they’re lighter
than headsets and easy to take on and oﬀ. So these may become as ubiquitous as
phones. It will be an engineering marvel to get there, of course, and while Apple is a
strong contender Facebook may be the most likely company to be able to ship them
given its progress with Oculus and founder-led innovation.
Why will AR glasses be so big? If you think about how much of your life is spent
looking at a screen, whether it’s a laptop or a phone or a watch, >50% of your waking
hours is already spent in the matrix. AR glasses would reduce “screen” time in one
sense, freeing you up to compute on the go without looking at a screen per se, but
increase digital time in another sense, as people would constantly have these HUDs
active to see the world.
This means even more of our daily experience will blend not just the physical world
dominatedbynaturallaw, butthedigitalworldrunbyhuman-writtencode. Theoﬄine
world still exists, physics and biology still exist, but algorithms and databases run even
more of human existence. The Network surrounds us to an even greater extent than
the State did.
If combined with some kind of gesture interface (gloves, rings, or perhaps just sophis-
ticated motion tracking), you might be able to use your hands to do anything in the
digital realm. So, with AR glasses, the digital and physical realms fully blend, and
people would actually be able to see and interact with an open metaverse in real life.4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 177",626
118,"4.4.2 Experimental Macroeconomics
Cryptoeconomics is transforming macroeconomics into an experimental subject.
Why? Because you can actually issue a currency, set a monetary policy, get opt-in
participants, and test your theories in practice. The proof is in the pudding. And, if
successful, the pudding is worth many billions of dollars.
This refutes the premise that economics and business are wholly disjoint. They aren’t
disjoint at all. Microeconomics is the theory of individuals and ﬁrms, which is directly
related to running a business. Each price you set, each company you start, is a kind of
microeconomic experiment (albeit usually a poorly-controlled one).
Macroeconomics, by contrast, until recently was oﬀ-limits to experiment. A ﬁrst step
forward was MIT’s Edward Castronova early work on virtual economies like World of
Warcraft. Now anyone can create a cryptocurrency, set monetary policy, and see what
happens.
Perhaps the closest thing to experimental macroeconomics prior to cryptocurrency was
the experience of setting up & scaling massive two-sided marketplaces like Airbnb,
eBay, Google Ads, etc.
You quickly learn that ideology is a poor guide. Naive libertarianism and progressivism
both fail. Why? Basically, people want to make money on those platforms. They
absolutely do respond to incentives, unlike the naive progressive model that it’ll all
be altruistic behavior. But the marketplace operator has immense power to shape

the world - if we’re lucky - builds a stable alternative of opt-in startup societies that
peacefully rejects these extremes.
To be clear, you don’t need to believe in this scenario to build startup societies and
network states. But it’s a mental model for the future, which we present for the same
reason that Ray Dalio put out a (somewhat euphemistic) model of how the US order178 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
could fall to an external competitor, and Peter Turchin put out a (less euphemistic)
model of how the US could fall into internal disorder.",214
120,"4.5.1 American Anarchy
Prosperity, Tyranny, or Anarchy?
The progressive vision is that the West is getting more free, equal, and prosperous.
The dystopian vision is that we’re actually in the incipient stages of tyranny, whether
that be fascist or woke respectively. What’s under-theorized is a third possibility:
namely that, in the US at least, the inconclusive power struggle between Democrats
and Republicans means America is headed for anarchy.
As the events of 2021 unfolded, it became clear that even with uniﬁed control of the
federal government, the Democrats were no more eﬀective than the Republicans had
been with comparable power four years earlier. Neither faction proved capable of
implementing the total top-down domination that some in their party advocated and
many in the other party feared.
Meanwhile, the non-partisan state-capacity of the US as a whole continued to visibly
decay. Squint past the pandemic’s half-ignored, TSA-like COVID regulations and you
saw a half-ignored, TSA-like COVID regulator – namely, a failing state that people did
half-ignore, and arguably had to half-ignore, because the USA itself was now the TSA,
and the TSA, they knew, was safety theater.
Today, in the territory governed by this inept bureaucracy, we now see power outages,
supply-chain shortages, rampant ﬂooding, and uncontrolled ﬁres. We see riots, arsons,
shootings, stabbings, robberies, andmurders. Weseedigitalmobsthatbecomephysical
mobs. We see a complete loss of trust in institutions from the state to the media. We
see anti-capitalism and anti-rationalism. We see states breaking away from the US
federal government, at home and abroad. And we see the End of Power, the Revolt of
the Public, the defeat of the military, the inﬂation of the dollar, and - looming ahead
- an American anarchy.
What’s coming isn’t fascism or communism, like the left-wing and right-wing pundits
would have us believe, even though they don’t believe it themselves. What’s coming is
the exact opposite of that, a world where the civilized concepts of freedom and equity
are extrapolated to their decivilizational limit, where you ain’t the boss of me and we
are all equal, where all hierarchy is illegitimate and with it all authority, where no one
is in charge and everything is in chaos.4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 179
We can argue this may be preferable to the status quo, in the same way some think
the chaotic Russia of the 1990s was on balance better than the authoritarian Soviet
Union of the 1980s. We can argue it may be inevitable; as the Chinese proverb goes,
“the empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.” And we can argue
that this transitional period of anarchy may be lamentable, but that it’s better than
the other team being in charge, and that we can build a better order on the other side.
Maybe so, and that’s what this book is about. But prior to any rebundling, I think
we’re on track for quite the unbundling.
Maximalist vs Woke
With that poetic introduction over, let’s get down to speciﬁcs. Rather than seeing
an indeﬁnite continuation of the postwar order, or the long Second Cold War between
the US and China that many are preparing for, the US may be on track to descend
into an American Anarchy, a chaotic Second American Civil War between the US
Establishment and its people.
We foresee two main factions. The ﬁrst will align around the US federal govern-
ment, NYT/establishmentmedia, wokeness, thedollar, andtheDemocratparty; they’ll
say they’re ﬁghting for “democracy” against “insurrectionists.” The second will align
around state governments, decentralized media, maximalism, Bitcoin, and the Repub-
lican party; they’ll say they’re ﬁghting for “freedom” against ﬁat “tyranny.” We can’t
predict their names, but rather than Democrat Blue and Republican Red, let’s call
them Wokes and Maximalists, or (more neutrally) Dollar Green and Bitcoin Orange.
Crucially, in this scenario, many non-whites will switch sides from Democrat Blue to
Bitcoin Orange, because whether black, white, Latino, or Asian, everyone’s savings
will be crushed by inﬂation. Many tech founders and independent writers will also go
Orange; tools like Square Cash will facilitate mass exodus to Bitcoin, and newsletter
writers will put out narratives that contest establishment media.
Conversely, many institutional loyalists will ﬂip from Republican Red to Dollar Green,
including the police, military, and neoconservatives, simply because they are in the
ﬁnal analysis the kind of team players and “natural conservatives” who would have
fought for both Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union. My country, right or wrong.
The role of centralized tech companies will be key. By default they’ll swing to the
Dollar Green side, but many tech founders will lean Bitcoin Orange, so we could see
centralized tech companies supporting both sides — with older and fully wokiﬁed ﬁrms
like Google ﬁrmly on the Green side, and newer founder-controlled ﬁrms located in
places like Miami and Texas trending Orange.
How America Builds Towards Conﬂict
How could something as radical as a Second American Civil War happen? You could
write a book on this, and several people have, but in lieu of that we’ll give a bullet
pointed list. Before reviewing it, you might want to re-read Ray Dalio, Peter Turchin,180 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
and Strauss & Howe if you want more context, as we won’t be able to recapitulate
every citation that informs this projection. Done? OK, here we go.
1.Political polarization is way up. All the graphs show this now. The US is not
really a “nation state” any more, but a binational country comprised of two war-
ring ethnic groups that disagree on fundamental moral premises. It is about “god,
gays, and guns”, but it’s also also about censorship, surveillance, and inﬂation.
2.State capacity is way down. ThecompetentAmericaofmid-century, theleft/right
fusion that FDR put together, the America that combined a powerful centralized
state with social conservatism, the America depicted in countless movies, the
America that won World War Two and the Cold War — that country is over.
This US government can’t build a bathroom in San Francisco, let alone a cost-
eﬀective ﬁghter jet, destroyer, combat ship, or aircraft carrier.
3.Economic prosperity is declining. All the political inﬁghting of the last decade
happened during a period of relative prosperity, even if it was based on the
artiﬁcial expedient of printing money. But now that we face potentially years of
inﬂation and stagnation, unhappiness will increase. Already you’re seeing articles
coming trying to acclimatize people to lower standards of living, to “eat bugs and
live in a pod.” And Turchin’s cliodynamical graphs put numbers to these feelings.
4.Envy is increasing. This is normally phrased in terms of “inequality”, and that is
indeed one way to look at it, but let’s rotate it by a few degrees and talk about
envy. The return of great fortunes, the rise of social media, and the decline in
religion has led to escalating envy. Every day, people can see others online who
appear to be better oﬀ than they are, and who appear to be rising while they are
falling. Whether that rise is real or not, whether it is due to the other person’s
own eﬀorts or not – it doesn’t really matter to the person who feels they aren’t
getting ahead, who feels they are falling behind.
Without a rising tide that lifts all boats, the “rational” act for some is to sink the
other boats, to pull escaping crabs down into the bucket. Why? Because misery
loves company, and because stopping someone from getting too far ahead means
theycan’toutcompeteyouforhousesormates. Theonlywayoutofthisnegative-",1999
121,"sum trap is to build provably positive-sum systems and high-trust societies. But
that’s exactly what the US establishment is not doing.It’s fomenting hatred
on social media every day, and giving new reasons not to trust it — whether that
be the insistent assurance that inﬂation is transitory or all the other episodes of
oﬃcial misinformation.
5.Foreign military defeat looms. Leaving aside your feelings about the pandemic,4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 181
the military propaganda beforehand is worth reviewing. In 2018, the US De-
partment of Defense put out press releases on its preparation for a pandemic, on
its sophisticated vaccines...and then nothing happened. This was the ﬁrst time
many in the public had the opportunity to directly compare statements about
“secret military programs” to the actual results, just as you might compare pro-
jections by corporate executives to the actual results. And the size of that gap
was remarkable. It indicated that at least some of the US military was just words,
and not real.
I remarked on this in early 2021, months before the defeat in Afghanistan gave
yet another example of the gap between US military rhetoric and reality, where
Kabul wasn’t going to fall in a few days and then it did.
As of this writing, we’re four months into the Russo-Ukrainian war of 2022.
After an initial surge of attention, global interest in the conﬂict has dropped oﬀ
a cliﬀ. The New York Times and other establishment media outlets have now
instructed the US administration to pursue peace, and various reports indicate
that the Ukrainians are quickly plowing through ammunition stockpiles while the
Russians are gaining ground with long-range artillery. To be clear, it’s not at all
obvious what will happen - there’s fog of war with everything - but in the event
of an outright Russian victory, deﬁned as gaining territory they didn’t have prior
to the war, that wouldn’t augur well for the US establishment.
6.US states are pulling away from the feds. There’s enormous coverage of US poli-
tics at the national level, because it attracts clicks from all over. But local politics
doesn’t get the same attention. However, if you’ve been paying attention, there
hasbeen a multi-decadal trend wherein states have been pulling away from the
federal government and each other on matters like guns, immigration, abortion,
gambling, marijuana, and other matters. This is part of the Future is Our Past
thesis: it’s reversing the de facto 10th Amendment repeal by FDR’s government,
and more broadly is part of the gradual Western decentralization since the peak
centralization of 1950.
7.Authority has lost respect. The old American left said something like “we all need
to work for the common good” while the old right said something like “pay your
dues and you’ll achieve the American dream.” The new left says “we are all equal”
and the new right says “you ain’t the boss of me.” So, the old left/right combina-
tion supported self-sacriﬁce and a stable hierarchy, while the new one attacks
all hierarchy as fundamentally illegitimate, as oppressive or tyrannical. This is
reﬂected in the defacement and degradation of virtually every US institution over
the last few decades, from the oﬃce of the presidency to the statues of American
founders. George Washington and the US Capitol are no longer sacred.182 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
8.National divorce is discussed. Secession is now oﬃcially part of the platform
for Texas’ Republicans. And there have been an increasing number of pieces on
the topic of “national divorce” from Democrats and Republicans alike, including
NYMag (“No, We Can’t Get a National Divorce”), Stephen Marche ( The Next
Civil War ), Barbara Walter ( How Civil Wars Start ), Michael Malice (“The Case
for American Secession”), David Reaboi (“National Divorce Is Expensive, But It’s
Worth Every Penny”), and the American Mind (“The Separation”).
9.Radicalized movements reject the status quo. There have been countless words
written on wokeness, on how it’s a radical ideology that thinks of the US as in-
trinsically corrupt — as systemically x-ist for many values of x — and therefore
doesn’t really seek to reform America so much as to capture the state to com-
pletely transform it. See Wesley Yang, Richard Hanania, Matthew Yglesias, John
McWhorter, Bari Weiss, and many others for discussion of diﬀerent aspects of
this.
The thing about wokeness is that it’s not just a superﬁcial weed growing out
of the topsoil. It has a root system, a theory of history and ethics that’s built
on thousands of papers, on generations of academic humanists, on Foucault and
Derrida and the like, on deconstruction and critical race theory and so on. I
happen to think of it as a mostly evil doctrine, as sophisticated evil promoted in
the name of good, but I recognize it has ideological content.
The Republican party isn’t really capable of dealing with that. But Bitcoin
Maximalism is. If you haven’t heard of it, you will. Bitcoin Maximalism is by
far the most important ideology in the world that many people haven’t heard of
- yet.
There’s philosophical depth to Maximalism. It represents a root-and-branch re-
jection of the inﬂation that powers the US government and thus pays for every-
thing. It fuses the worldview of Mises, Rothbard, Hayek, and Ron Paul with
Bitcoin. It naturally aligns with the loss of trust in institutions, with the suspi-
cious individual who (understandably!) no longer trusts the federal government
or US institutions on anything. It’s not merely an edit to the state, it’s the end of
the state. And it’s a push from an ideological direction the Wokes are ill-prepared
for, because it’s an aracial ultra-libertarianism rather than the white nationalism
that folks like Marche and Walter thinkwill be their foe.
If you want to understand Bitcoin Maximalism, read The Bitcoin Standard or
the tweets from accounts at hive.one/bitcoin (not all are Maximalists). But be
aware: just like wokes who reject “civility” on ideological grounds, maximalists
have developed verbal justiﬁcations for being “toxic.”
I disagree with the fundamental moral premise of Maximalism, which is that
Bitcoin is the only coin and all other digital assets are sins.I don’t believe in4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 183
one coin anymore than I believe in one state or one god. But I understand the
power that such a belief system has. Americans don’t believe in one god anymore,
don’t believe in monotheism. So their choice is between one state and one coin,
between ideological monostatism and mononumism.
That is, to beat something like the US establishment in a civil conﬂict, you don’t
just need bravery, you need a more powerful Schelling Point. That’s what Bitcoin
is for the Maximalists: the one coin that’s the alternative to the one state. If and
when the dollar collapses due to inﬂation, the orange coin becomes the new blue
jeans, the global symbol of freedom and prosperity.
(And what’s the alternative to thatalternative? Many network states as al-
ternative to one nation state, many coins as alternatives to the one coin, many
beliefs as the alternative to one belief system. That’s the polystatist, polynumist,
polytheist model we describe later on in the Recentralized Center .)
10.Bitcoin seizure could be the trigger event. All of this is a combustible mix, and
there are many possible trigger events, but one that I see as particularly likely is
a combination of (a) ruinous inﬂation followed by (b) a soaring BTC/USD price
and then (c) the attempt by an insolvent federal government to seize Bitcoin from
citizens.
On the Bitcoin side, this isn’t a short-term price prediction or anything, and there
are of course various possible failure modesfor BTC that could prevent Bitcoin",1999
122,"from being the speciﬁc cryptocurrency that drives this scenario. Nevertheless,
because the Bitcoin protocol has mostly been technologically ﬁxed for a while,
its partisans have focused to a much greater extent on political innovation – like
getting it recognized as a sovereign currency. Add in the moral importance that
Maximalists attach to Bitcoin, and its global name recognition, and BTC is likely
to be the coin of contention.
On the other side, the general concept of asset seizure isn’t really even very sci-ﬁ
given the overnight freezing of funds for Canadian truckers and 145M Russian
nationals. The main diﬀerence is that cryptocurrency is built to be hard to freeze.184 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
A bankrupt state can and will try to seize funds held at centralized exchanges,
but for those that have taken their funds oﬀ exchanges, the state will need to go
house-to-house, and rubber hoses don’t scale.
A US establishment attempt to seize Bitcoin in a time of high inﬂation would be
like a repeat of FDR’s gold seizure (Executive Order 6102), except it’d be done
during a time of declining state capacity rather than rising centralization.
The reason something like this could be the trigger event is that neither side could
easily back down: Wokes would have no power if their state went bankrupt, and
Maximalists would have no money if they surrendered to the state.
Thus, this seems like a relatively foreseeable event that could kick oﬀ the Sec-
ond American Civil War — especially if the seizure bill is passed by the federal
government and some states refuse to enforce it.
How could that happen? A state-level refusal to enforce might just be part of the
growing divergence between states from the federal government and each other,
similar to the justiﬁcation for sanctuary cities and the like. But if you wanted
a statutory rationale, you could imagine a Constitutional Amendment proposed
to ban Bitcoin seizure, something that would put the right to hold BTC on par
with the right to free speech and the right to bear arms. Such an amendment
could be ratiﬁed by many states in the run up to a possible seizure bill. Even if
it didn’t pass nationally, any ratifying states would then cite their ratiﬁcation to
justify their refusal to enforce.
A War for Minds, Not Lands
It’s a mistake to think a Second American Civil War would look anything like the ﬁrst
Civil War, or like World War 2 for that matter. It’d be nothing like the movies with
huge movements of uniformed soldiers, tanks, and planes.
Instead it’ll just be a continuation and escalation of what we’ve seen over the last
several years: a network-to-network war to control minds, rather than state-to-state
war to control territory. A fusion of America’s domestic conﬂicts on social networks
and its foreign conﬂicts in the Middle East.
The best way to visualize this is to look at the physical map of Union-vs-Confederate
right before the Civil War, the physical map of Republican-vs-Democrat by county,
and then the digital map of Republican-vs-Democrat in the same period.
IntheﬁrstCivilWar, ideologyandgeographystronglycoincided. Thevictorycondition
for the North was obvious: invade the South. Conquer the territory to conquer the
minds. They didn’t have to kill every last Confederate, they just had to show that
resistance was futile to get the remaining Confederates to stop ﬁghting.
In any second Civil War, ideology and geography would only weakly coincide. Look
again at that map by county. Is one side really going to invade the other? Or vice4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 185
versa? Is the US establishment going to seize corn ﬁelds or will its opponents move to
capture big blocks of cities? Is either side going to use huge bombs on territories where
they’d kill at least 30% of their own team? Could nuclear weapons be targeted enough
to use as political tools to get the other side to concede?
No. Instead it’ll be a war for minds, not lands. And if we look at the map of digital
space, suddenly much becomes clear. Here, the two sides are fully separated, as the
Union and Confederacy were. And now we can see why there’s been such an emphasis
on cancellation, deplatforming, silencing, and shunning...on making people say certain
words and hoist certain symbols. Because making a person or a company post a
particularhashtagindicates control of minds whichisinturn control of digital territory .
All the discussion over the last few years around “free speech” doesn’t really engage the
fundamental issue, which is that this is a time of information war, where the victory
condition for one side is to invade the minds of the other side – because it cannot
feasibly invade the territory.
To invade the minds of the other side, and to control the digital networks – because
the tech companies that greenlight transactions, communications, and online behavior
have in many ways become the de facto privatized governments of the Western world.
The power to determine what people can and cannot do in the digital world belongs to
the people who run these networks. And so controlling these networks, by controlling
the minds of people who run them, is the key to maintaining control over the US in a
digital time. That’s why there’s been such a push by the US establishment to wokify
the big tech companies.
However, a network that can’t be controlled in this way, and that isn’t run by any one
person – like Bitcoin – well, that’s a form of resistance. The set of web3 networks that
are more decentralizedthan centralized Silicon Valley tech companies, that are run
by communities – those too are a form of resistance.
As such, if the ﬁrst Civil War was the “War Between the States”, the second Civil War
will be the “War Between the Networks.” The graphs we’ve shown relate to Red-vs-
Blue, but add a tint of yellow to each group and rotate it a bit. Then you’ll get what
we think is the likely future axis of conﬂict, which is Bitcoin-Orange-vs-Dollar-Green.
In areas where Greens control the state, they may use militarized police, tech company
surveillance, deplatforming, denunciation in media, arrests, seizures, and the like. In
those areas, Orange may respond with an insurgency campaign that looks like Northern
Ireland or the Middle East. But in areas where Oranges control the state, and Greens186 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
are in the minority, these tactics could reverse. Think about the BLM riots, or Jan 6,
or the doxxing of Supreme Court Justices by angry establishmentarians, or the various
street ﬁghts between right and left, or the constant digital struggle that plays out online
every day, and project out a future where those kind of network warfare tactics become
daily occurrences. Like the portmanteau “lawfare”, think of this as “netwar.”
Maximalist vs Woke Rotates Left and Right
The reason the terms “left” and “right” don’t exactly ﬁt for the projected conﬂict of
OrangevsGreenisthatinmanyrespectstheBitcoinOrangewouldbethe revolutionary
classfaction and the Dollar Greens would be the ruling class faction.
Basically, those who side with the US establishment in this scenario would be the
same personality type as those who sided with the ancien regime during the French
Revolution: they’d be ﬁghting to preserve the past. Their message would be one of
particularism, of American nationalism, of continued dollar supremacy.
By contrast, those who side with Bitcoin Maximalism would be a revolutionary per-
sonality ﬁghting to overturn what they saw as tyranny. Their message would be one
of universalism, of a system that puts everyone worldwide on the same playing ﬁeld —
and that doesn’t privilege America over the rest of the globe like the dollar does.
This will be an extremely uncomfortable position for the US establishment, because
for the ﬁrst timein memory they’ll represent the technologically conservative faction,
the less universalist side, the pre-modern side.
But you can already see the foreshadowing in terms of how legacy media inveighs
against technology, how they hate the future, how they want to jam social media and",1982
123,"the internet back into the garage, how they want to turn back the clock on all those
things that have disrupted their political control.
Maximalism is thus a kind of leapfrogging. If Trump invoked a mythical past, and the
US establishment represents an attempt to freeze the present in amber, the Bitcoin
Maximalists are willing to drive the system towards an uncertain future. That’s why
a fair number of conservative Republicans will side with Green, and why revolutionary
Democrats will side with Orange. Bitcoin Maximalism is a movement that knows it
can’t “Make America Great Again”, because that America no longer exists and perhaps
never did, so it’s willing to take the entire ﬁat system down.
Orange is thus comfortable with a higher level of chaos than a suddenly conservative
US establishment. It is ok with the uncertainty of crypto-anarchy over the certainty of
inﬂationary tyranny. And it is not looking to mend the federal government, but to end
it. Unlike the reformist Republican, Maximalism is playing to win. And so it might.4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 187
Who Wins?
It’s extremely diﬃcult to forecast what happens, but I do think that in the long run
the Maximalists may win at least someterritory in a Second American Civil War,
because they’ll eventually outlast the money printing of the US establishment. The
value proposition in the American regions that go Maximalist will be “freedom”, though
others will perceive it as anarchy.
Why could Maximalists win a war of attrition? Every day the price of BTC/USD goes
up is another victory in the Maximalist social war against the US establishment; every
day it goes down is a temporary defeat.Because the US government can’t invade
the rest of the world, and because other states won’t necessarily listen to it, it can’t
easily seize Bitcoin globally. So long as the long-term price trend is up, which is not
guaranteed, then Maximalists win.
That does lead to a related point: with an estimated 300M cryptocurrency holders
worldwide at the time of writing, hundreds of millions of people who aren’t Maximal-
ists already believe in Bitcoin. And it’s on track to be billions by 2030. So long as
those holders don’t sell their Bitcoin, that’s a fundamentally new international support
network of a kind that MAGA Republicans don’t have. That is, a man in Brazil doesn’t
necessarily care about American Republicans vs Democrats — he’s not an American
nationalist, and doesn’t have a dog in that ﬁght — but he may well hold Bitcoin. And
so long as he doesn’t sell BTC for dollars, he’s indirectly supporting Maximalists. Yet
his foreign support comes in an intangible and ideological form that feels acceptable to
the proud American Bitcoin Maximalist, as opposed to (say) the explicit support of a
foreign military getting involved on US soil.
With that said, the US establishment could also win a war of attrition. Their starting
advantages are immense: the universities, the media, the military, the intelligence
agencies, most of the tech companies, and the federal government itself. The US
establishment also has an elite global support base: all the people who sympathize
with it around the world: the McKinsey types, the Ivy grads, the frequent ﬂyer class,
and the people who still think America is the country from the movies.Even if
the establishment can’t force foreign governments to seize BTC, they may try seizing
Bitcoin for their own reasons, though other states will instead vector towards the
direction of economic freedom.188 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
Moreover, even if the US establishment does lose someterritory, it will likely hang
on to the Northeast and the West Coast. The value proposition in those regions that
stick with the establishment will be “democracy”, though others will perceive it as ﬁat
“tyranny”.
During all this, the pressure of conﬂict could force people to the ideological extremes.

Wars Aren’t Romantic
If it’s not abundantly clear, I take no sides here, and am not rooting for anarchy. I’d
prefer a stable world where we could focus on mathematics and getting to Mars than
the chaos that may soon ensue. And I have no illusions about how bad civil conﬂict can
get; there are no unscathed winners in wars. Read David Hines for a good depiction of
what political violence is actually like.
Political violence is like war, like violence in general: people have a fan-
tasy about how it works. This is the fantasy of how violence works: you
SMITE YOUR ENEMIES IN A GRAND AND GLORIOUS CLEANSING
BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU’RE BETTER.
Grand and glorious smiting isn’t actually how violence works. I’ve worked
a few places that have had serious political violence. And I’m not sure how
to really describe it so people get it. This is a stupid comparison, but here:
imagine that one day Godzilla walks through your town. The next day, he
does it again. And he keeps doing it. Some days he steps on more people
than others. That’s it. That’s all he does: trudging through your town,
back and forth.
Your town’s not your town now; it’s The Godzilla Trudging Zone.
Point: civil conﬂict is not romantic, it’s not targeted, it’s not proportional. It’s insane.
If you think the scenario of American Anarchy is a possibility, you probably want to
get as far away from it as you can, regardless of your “sympathies” with either side.
And then you should help build a peaceful alternative to American Anarchy. But not
the alternative that China will oﬀer, which we’ll cover next.",1424
124,"4.5.2 Chinese Control
Attempted Coup Leads to Total Control
While in the West we may see American Anarchy, in the East we could see Chinese
Control.
Before the US enters serious internal conﬂict, it could support some kind of China Coup4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 189
— whether with words or with more than that — as written about by Roger Garside in
the eponymous book China Coup , as hinted at by parties as diﬀerent as George Soros
and America’s JSOC, and as previously accomplished in many acknowledged regime
changes and unacknowledged Color Revolutions around the world.
For reasons we’ll get into, I don’t think such a coup is likely to be successful. But
the reaction to any coup attempt by the CCP could be the most intense crackdown
on domestic opposition we’ve ever seen. It would be an AI-powered ripping up of
Chinese society by the roots that puts every citizen under suspicion and makes it very
diﬃcult for Chinese nationals to leave with their property, to “runxue”. It may also be
accompanied by deniable (or overt) Chinese retaliation against the US for attempting a
coup, retaliation which could take the form of targeted shortages of key physical goods
to exacerbate American inﬂation and supply chain woes.
If and when the coup is quashed, the CCP will then export their coup-defeating surveil-
lance state to other countries. And their value proposition to the world will be Chinese
Control — the complete opposite of American Anarchy.
China Blocks the Exits
A speciﬁc prediction is that we’ll see a world where it becomes increasingly diﬃcult for
Chinese people to leave the country or get their property out of the digital yuan ecosys-
tem without CCP permission. Take the existing hukousystem of internal passports,
the WeChat system of red/yellow/green travel restrictions based on health status, the
aggressive COVID lockdowns, and the recent passport restrictions — then fuse them
with a surveillance state that can track people globally, a WeChat superapp that can
unperson them, and a digital yuan that can freeze their assets.
Therearetrendsthatpointinthedirectionofdigitalandphysicalmovementrestriction
already. Chinesepassportissuancehasalreadydeclineddramatically, down“95percent
in the ﬁrst quarter compared to before the pandemic.” Outbound travel is similarly
down 95%, with 8.5 million people leaving China in 2021 relative to 154 million in
2019. China has also been using COVID quarantine codes to stop people from moving
money or moving around. And Chinese capital controls, always strict, may get even
more intense with the rollout of the digital yuan. So that makes exit hard.
Conversely, on the entrance side, while it will still be possible for approved Chinese
citizens to travel to places like Iran or Russia that are eﬀectively military allies, the
countries where the Chinese state lacks a hard power presence will start turning down
Chinese nationals due to espionage concerns. This has already been happening.
This combination of outbound restrictions imposed by theirgovernment and inbound
restrictions from othergovernments will make life hard for the Chinese liberals and
internationalists who disagree with the system, the “runxue” types. They won’t be
able to politically dissent, but it’ll also be hard for them to leave the country with their
property, as many will want to do. Such an act will be prevented or portrayed as a
traitorous run-on-the-bank, particularly if the economy isn’t doing well. Think about190 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
how enthusiastic Putin has been about the “renationalization of the elites”, and how
closely the CCP has been watching Western tactics during the Russo-Ukraine War.
They recognize that any commercial linkage with the West is a point of vulnerability
during a conﬂict. So it’s quite likely that CCP will increasingly make it diﬃcult for
people to exit physically or digitally.
The Path to Chinese Control
What are the factors that lead us to this prediction, that CCP will emphasize the
“loyalty” part of Hirschman’s triad and turn strongly against both voice andexit?
1.Shutting down opposition across the spectrum. This plot from MERICs is worth
looking at, as it reminds us that the CCP is not solely against US-style “democ-
ratization”, but also against many diﬀerent kinds of ideologies that diﬀer from
the party-state’s current line. Whether that opposition is Maoist (like Bo Xilai),
democratic (like Hong Kong and Taiwan), Islamic (like the Uighurs), Christian
(like the churches), technologist (like Jack Ma and other founders), or even ultra-
nationalist, the CCP stands at the middle of an ideological circle and constantly
monitors everyone for deviation.
2.Inculcating Chinese nationalism. Just as the US has gone through a Great Awo-
kening since the 2013, Chinese society has been driven by Xuexi Qiangguo into a
phase of ultra-nationalism. There is opposition to this internally, but it remains
to be seen whether it actually ﬂipsthe nationalism or simply moderates it.
3.Building a surveillance state. Much has been written on this, but the sheer scale
of what has been built isn’t well understood. While it’s worth being aware of
Gell-Mann amnesia, this is actually an area where US establishment media is
closer to reality than it is domestically, in part because relative to the Chinese
state it’s actually opposition media. See videos like this from DW and this.
4.Hooking it into AI. Read Kai-Fu Lee’s AI Superpowers and then read this, this,
andthis. SupplementitwithDanWang’sletters, orthis2019postfromaChinese
intellectual published at Reading the Chinese Dream that is still able to question
the deployment of all the surveillance.
5.Piloting the system during COVID. The green/yellow/red health codes rolled out
on WeChat during the early days of COVID are used for travel restrictions - and
have been repurposed to simply prevent people from traveling in a deniable way.
6.Cutting oﬀ digital and physical exit. Misbehavior in China can get you removed
from WeChat, which is like unpersoning you given how many services it’s hooked
into, public and private. More recently, China has repeatedly made it diﬃcult
to leave the country on the grounds that doing so would spread COVID: “Trips
in or out of the country made by mainland citizens in 2021 plunged nearly 80%
compared with the level in 2019, NIA data showed.”
7.Selling to other governments. Both China and the US have sold surveillance4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 191
technology to the globe, but one diﬀerence is that China can execute better in
the physical world - so smart cities built with Chinese technology have full-stack
surveillance.
8.Justifying as anti-imperialism. The educational system and the big-screen movies
likeBattle of Lake Changjin andWolf Warrior 2 position China as defending
itself from Western imperialism. And this ﬁlters down to the small scale, like
this video of an oﬃcial defending Shanghai’s lockdown with the narrative that
China will eventually have a war with the US, so citizens need to get in line for
the lockdown.
9.Pointing to relative stability. The “Harmonious Society” narrative begun under
Hu Jintao has been mentioned less in an international context by Xi Jinping,
who has not exactly been pursuing harmony abroad. But it’s still a useful tool
to justify social control – like NYT talks about censorship and social controls to
preserve “democracy”, CCP talks about censorship to maintain “harmony.”
10.China Coup could be the trigger event. The US establishment has put out videos
and articles that come close to calling for a coup in China. George Soros broadly
hints at it in speeches like this. And folks like Roger Garside literally wrote a
book on it.
An attempted coup, whether actually American-backed or simply accused of being
such, could be the trigger event for rolling out a fearsome system of Chinese Control.
AI would be turned on the population, and any even mildly Western-sympathic groups
would be pattern-recognized and dug out by their roots. Nationalist mobs might par-
ticipate, online or even in person. It could get very ugly.",1984
125,"The last part is important: Chinese Control would have signiﬁcant popular support.
The country is heavily nationalist now. It is possible the swing towards nationalism
partially reverses — there are signiﬁcant factions in China who do not like the current
trend — but I think it’s too much to think that China is going to “go democratic.”
America’s internal chaos means it is simply not an admirable model for much of the
world anymore, and while some educated Chinese liberals may indeed want to runxue,
there is momentum towards nationalism among much of China’s youth. I may be
wrong about this, but putting it all on one person or even one party doesn’t feel right.
The ideological current towards Chinese ultra-nationalism feels stronger than Xi the
person, or even the CCP, and may outlast him in the event of a black swan.
Anyway, with the coup defeated, CCP would then sell a turnkey version of their coup-
defeating surveillance state to other countries as a way to (a) stop any possible con-
tagion of American anarchy, (b) control crime, (c) prevent increasingly mobile citizens
from leaving with their funds to other countries, and (d) prevent unrest of any kind, le-
gitimate or not. It would ensure that any leader currently in charge remains in charge,
and would be picked by many governments for exactly that reason.192 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
China Caveat
There’s an important caveat to all this. Much Western coverage of China is unremit-
tingly negative. And certainly the scenario described herein is not a particularly rosy
one. But we need to temper that negativity with a dose of realism.
First, why are we even discussing China? Why aren’t we discussing Chad or Chile?
Because China has on balance executed phenomenally well since 1978. After Deng
Xiaoping’s reforms, the country really has risen to the workshop of the world, with an
enormous trade surplus, a surfeit of hard currency, and dozens of huge new cities. It’s
the #2 economy, the #2 military, and the #2 in tech unicorns. All of that happened
from a standing start over the last 40-odd years, since Deng’s turnaround of China
(called Boluan Fanzheng).
Conversely, over the last 30 or so years, the US establishment has squandered perhaps
the greatest lead in human history, going from complete and uncontested dominance in
1991 to internal conﬂict and potentially implosion. Moreover, as noted in What about
China, huh? , it’s not that the US establishment is more ethicalthan the CCP when
it comes to civil liberties, it’s just less competent. After all, the US establishment
also does warrantless surveillance via the NSA, unconstitutional search and seizure via
the TSA, arbitrary conﬁscation of property via civil forfeiture, censorship of political
keywords just like WeChat, and has pushed for disinformation agencies, civilian dis-
armament, digital censorship, and the like. The US establishment copied the CCP
on lockdown, without ever really admitting it was doing so, and funded the lab that
may have leaked the coronavirus. It’s also bombed and destabilized many countries
around the world. And if we’re honest, over the last two decades, the US has killed
and displaced far more people abroad than the CCP has.
That might be hard to hear for a Westerner, but what all of that means is that (a)
the CCP does have some cred with many “neutral” countries, (b) it also has cred with
huge swaths of its own population thanks in part to both nationalist propaganda and
actual execution, (c) that relative cred will grow if America descends into anarchy, (d)
the cred will make it easier for CCP to roll out more Chinese Control at home and
abroad, and (e) the cred will actually attract some Chinese ancestry people back to
China even as others want to leave.
Wait – that last point seems paradoxical. How could people want to come to Chinese
Control if we’ve just spent all this time talking about so many want to leave?
Think about Microsoft. It’s a strong company. Most people in the world would be glad
to get a job at Microsoft. But many of the very best would ﬁnd it stiﬂing, and would
instead strike out on their own to join or found a tech company. There’s simultaneously
a demand for some people to join Microsoft while others want to leave.
In the case of China, this is compounded by China’s evaporating soft power in regions
where it doesn’t have hard power. The climate of suspicion towards Chinese nationals
has ramped up dramatically in recent years, and it’s generally not ﬂagged as “racism”4.5. AMERICAN ANARCHY, CHINESE CONTROL, INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIATE 193
by the establishment press. This could make a good number of Chinese ancestry people
leave rather than be singled out in the event of a hot conﬂict.
So, that’s what could happen to China: signiﬁcant inﬂows of Chinese ancestry people,
along with some outﬂows (or blocked outﬂows) of elites.
And the Chinese Control scenario we’ve described, while dystopian to the ambitious
and freedom-seeking, will likely be acceptable to many people who prize stability over
all else and see scenes of ﬂames and gunﬁre (whether representative or not) coming
from American Anarchy. It won’t be trivial to beat the average standard of living that
Chinese Control may be capable of delivering. It will appeal to many. And that brings
us to the International Intermediate.",1304
126,"4.5.3 International Intermediate
What’s the International Intermediate?
They’re just the people who don’t want their societies to descend into American An-
archy, but also want a better option than Chinese Control. That’s India and Israel,
but also American centrists, Chinese liberals, global technologists, and people from
other places that want to steer a diﬀerent course from the US establishment, from
crypto-anarchy, andfrom Chinese Control.
Why mention India and Israel so prominently? Call it a hunch, but those two groups
are #1 and #2 in immigrant tech founders in the US. India is, separately, also #3 in
tech unicorns after the US and China. At the state level India and Israel are now highly
aligned, and at the individual level Indians and Israelis tend to be globally ﬂexible and
English-speaking.
So, insofar as there is a third technological pole outside the US and China, it will prob-
ably have signiﬁcant Indo-Israeli character, with servers positioned in their respective
territories, and deals inked across borders.
Of course, it will also have contributions from all around the world. It’s probably
easier to say who the International Intermediate is notthan who it is. It’s not the US
establishment, or places heavily aligned with it. And it’s not China or heavily China-
aligned regions like Russia and Iran. But it could include places like the Visegrad
countries (anti-Russia but also skeptical of much in America), or South Korea (which
elected a pro-Bitcoin head of state), or even Vietnam (now pulling away from China
to side more with India).
Because it’s “everyone else”, by default this International Intermediate is just raw ma-
terial – the 80% of the world that is not American or Chinese is just a formless mass
without internal structure. Indeed, that’s what happened to the “Third World” during
last century’s Cold War. The Non-Aligned countries weren’t just not aligned with the
US or USSR, they weren’t aligned with each other.
This time, however, rather than being the Third World / non-aligned movement, a194 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
subset of the many billions of people in the International Intermediate can align around
web3 to try to build alternatives to American Anarchy and Chinese Control. And that
subset we call the Recentralized Center .",564

Many video games have the concept of good and bad endings, like Shattered Union
and Starcraft. We’ll take that approach with the sci-ﬁ scenario we outlined, describing
someVictory Conditions for diﬀerent factions as well as Surprise Endings that give an
unexpected twist. Again, this is a way to think through an uncertain future with some
scenario analysis, not a hard and fast set of predictions.",102
128,"4.6.1 The Victory Conditions
The “Base Rate Fallacy” Fallacy
This is a scenario where the US establishment wins, and averts American Anarchy.
In 2020, Tyler Cowen wrote about how “base-raters” and “growthers” diﬀer regarding
the coronavirus. Growthers looked at the growth rate of the virus, which at the time
was exponential. Base-raters start by asking how often something has happened before;
they assume things will more or less stay the same.
So, base-raters assume the post-war order remains intact; the dollar remains number
one; the USA stays number one; China will collapse like Japan; everybody always says
the West is declining, but it’ll always reinvent itself; it’ll be okay; you’re too concerned
or worried about this, etc.
If the Base Rate Fallacy is assuming tomorrow will be like today, then the Base Rate
FallacyFallacyis assuming that the Base Rate Fallacy is always a fallacy. After all,
tomorrow often is like today! The growther always thinks that change is going to
happen, but it may not.
Sowhatdoestheestablishmentwinscenariolooklike? It’sthesamethingwe’vealready
got. The post-war order just keeps on keeping on in a zombiﬁed fashion. There’s no
dramatic acceleration or collapse. Instead, the West just keeps reinventing itself and
all is mostly well.
If you want a faithful rendition of this worldview, this thread by Vuk Vukovic is decent.
I disagree with many bits of it, including the idea that discord is our strength. And I
think in general that the thread is fairly anti-empirical; the graph of long-run interest
rate trends alone shows that something is going to run out of juice eventually. Still,
it’s worth a hearing.
China Can Make a Pencil
This is a scenario where the CCP wins, and Chinese Control triumphs.4.6. VICTORY CONDITIONS AND SURPRISE ENDINGS 195
How might China become the most prosperous and stable country in the world, even
if it’s unpopular in some places abroad, and even if the US attempts to ﬁnancially or
socially sanction it? China would become an autarkic autonomous autocracy.
To understand this, let’s start with a famous libertarian story: “The Pencil.” The
idea is that no one person can make a pencil. After all, a seemingly simple pencil is
composed of wood, graphite, yellow paint, the metal that contains the eraser, and the
eraser rubber itself. But creating each of these things in-house would require running a
variety of diﬀerent agricultural and mining operations. So instead of having one person
do all of that, the capitalist system makes a pencil in a “networked” way. We use
prices as an API, so that diﬀerent organizations can spin up, produce components in a
cost-eﬀective way, use their proﬁts to grow or maintain themselves, and adapt without
coordinating with each other.
But that was then. Maybe Chinese Communism with the digital yuan is diﬀerent.
What happens if you have a computer system which really doesknow about every
vendor, that has every record of every payment, that can actually see the global supply
chain, and that knows every single person (or robot) required to make that pencil? It is
a large, but ﬁnite problem after all. Maybe such a system can solve Hayek’s calculation
problem.
We already have proof points for this. If you run a two-sided marketplace, you’ll ﬁnd
contra Hayek that not allknowledge is local. For example, Sidecar lost to Uber because
drivers set prices themselves, as opposed to setting them centrally. Hayekians would
agree that Sidecar’s approach was optimal: drivers have local knowledge and central
planning can’t work. But Uber’s central planning didwork. They had a global view
of supply & demand. And riders wanted speed, not price shopping.
So, that’s what this win scenario contemplates. If China integrates AI with the digital
yuan, and makes their entire economy computable, at their scale they might actually
be able to make a pencil. And everything else.
Recall that previous abstractions like “six degrees of separation” or “written history” be-
came very real once social networks digitized decades of interaction and communication
by billions of people. So too would previous verbal abstractions like “the economy” or
“the supply chain” become actual computable objects when you have every transaction
and vendor in the same database. Basically, all the blockchain supply chain concept
actually couldwork, but only if all payments (and hence receipts) are on-chain — or
in something likea blockchain, which is what the digital yuan may be.
This is doubly true if AI-driven robots are carrying out many of these functions. China
might be able to internalize huge swaths of the economy. It could mean full stack
production of everything, hyperdeﬂation of living costs within China, where labor be-
comes electricity. In this scenario, no oneperson can make a pencil, but Chinacan
make a pencil, because they can algorithmically coordinate the supply chain of millions
of cooperating humans in a way no one has ever been able to do before. They’d still
need the raw materials, but their alliances with African countries, Russia, and places196 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
like Iran might take care of that.
It’s essentially the vision of Red Plenty , Soviet-style central planning made feasible
with superior computation androbotics — so that the robots actually did what you
said they’d do, and didn’t have that pesky self-interest getting in the way like humans
did. It’d be a riﬀ on Aaron Bastani’s fully automated luxury communism, where the
communistic parts would be the robotic parts — as they would lack any economic
interests of their own, and move as one.
In this win scenario, the Chinese Communists might have the highest standard of living
on the planet, as much higher than the US as the US was relative to the USSR, not
only because they actually make physical things, but because they could see the full
stack, have data on everything, track every transaction, and deploy AI and robotics in
the physical world.
Of course, that standard of living would be achieved in an ethnonationalist society
with a bone to pick with the US in particular. And it might result in a Greater East
Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere 2.0, this time under Chinese rather than Japanese terms.
Everyone would have to bend to Chinese hard power to get the beneﬁt of their robotic
economy.
In this scenario, the Chinese might even choose to copy the tactics America used in
the Russo-Ukrainian war: namely, physically sanction any group or state that opposes
them, thereby cutting them oﬀ from the supply of goods from an increasingly physically
autarkic China.
I don’t like this world, because it cuts against the convenient outcome of the late 20th
century, in which the system that produced freedom also produced prosperity. But the
experience of two-sided marketplaces shows it is a possibility.",1682
129,"4.6.2 The Surprise Endings
Duopoly of Digital Despotism
In this surprise ending, the U.S. establishment and the CCP work together to stop the
global Bitcoin and web3 insurgents. It would be like the US and the USSR aligning
against the Third World.
Now, therewasactuallyoneexamplewherethathappened, whentheUSandtheSoviet
Union were on the same side, and that was the ﬁrst Iraq War in 1990. The Soviet Union
actually voted with the US in the UN Security Council to condemn Iraq. That was a
huge moment, because normally they were reﬂexively oppositional.
The explicit version would be something like this, where the otherwise hostile US
establishment and CCP both decide that BTC and/or web3 are a threat to their power,
and try to denounce it at the level of the UN, a bit like their quasi-cooperation on non-
political issues.4.6. VICTORY CONDITIONS AND SURPRISE ENDINGS 197
There’s also an implicit version of it, where they team up without teaming up. The US
establishment on many levels admires the CCP crackdown on speech. For example, in
The Atlantic they said China took the right course on internet speech, and in the NYT
they noted that Free Speech Is Killing Us. The US establishment did copy Chinese
lockdown, without admitting it.
And so you could imagine them teaming up without teaming up, where China does
something, then the US establishment copies it, maybe without acknowledging it, and
theytherebyperformanunacknowledgedpincerattackagainsttechnologiesthatoppose
them, a bit like the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
We call that scenario the duopoly of digital despotism.
Bitcoin Ends Human War, but not Robot War
A key thesis of The Sovereign Individual – and an important argument for Bitcoin and
cryptocurrencies more generally – is that if a government cannot seize money, then it
cannot start wars.
Why? If a state can’t coerce, it can’t pay to enforce conscription, or pay the conscripts
themselves, or seize the money to pay for all the equipment needed to prosecute the
expensive industrialized wars of the 20th and early 21st century.
There’s a book called Gold, Blood, and Power: Finance and War Through the Ages
that describes how ﬁnance was a weapon of war, and that the 20th century was one of
the ﬁrst times where huge wars have been fought without any country running out of
money. The only thing the countries ran out of were bodies, because they were giant
centralized states that could seize everything in their territory, and could propagandize
everyone in their territory, and could just drive total war. So the Nazis, Soviets, and
Americans just grabbed everything in their territory to ﬁght these wars, like enormous
ghosts that commanded millions of bodies in these titanic ideological combats.
How did they command those bodies? If you think about The Tripolar Triangle, the
lower left corner of NYT is voice, and it’s convincing people with words. The lower
right corner of BTC is choice or exit, and it’s convincing people with money. You can
think of these as left and right democracy respectively.
But there’s a third pole. The top pole is loyalty. It’s CCP. Today, it’s AI. And it’s
convincing people without convincing people at all. Because they’re all literally one.
It’s harmony. And robots ﬁt at that pole. Why? Because unlike a human soldier, a
robot can’t be propagandized. And unlike a human soldier, a robot doesn’t need to be
paid, just charged.
So: the problem is that Bitcoin could end human war, but not robot War. There would
still be the question of funding the industrial capacity to manufacture the robots in the
ﬁrst place. But if you could get past that bootstrap problem...then there’s a scenario
where CCP’s AI beats both BTC and NYT, and war keeps going. And now the only198 CHAPTER 4. DECENTRALIZATION, RECENTRALIZATION
reliable soldiers are robot soldiers that can’t be propagandized by NYT and don’t need
to be paid in BTC.",975
130,"4.7 Towards a Recentralized Center
Our base scenario doesn’t contemplate an extended Second Cold War between com-
munism and capitalism.
But we do think that the choice between American Anarchy and Chinese Control can
be seen as a kind of global ideological struggle of a diﬀerent kind, as a choice between
decentralization and centralization.
Do you go with the failed centralization of NYT and the declining US establishment?
The total decentralization of Bitcoin Maximalism? Or the totalitarian centralization
of the CCP?
A better answer might be: none of the above. That instead of choosing either anarchic
decentralization or coercive centralization, we choose volitional recentralization .",154
131,"4.7.1 In Defense of Recentralization
When you mention a recentralized center, at ﬁrst it seems laughable. The centralists
will say “what’s the point of decentralizing then? Just stick with our existing system!”
And the decentralists will say “new boss, same as the old boss, I prefer freedom!”
Derisive references to Rube Goldberg Machines and Animal Farm will abound.
But the whole point is that the new boss is notthe same as the old boss, anymore
than Apple was the same as BlackBerry, Amazon was the same as Barnes and No-
ble, or America was the same as Britain. Recentralization means new leaders, fresh
blood. Just as companies and technologies keep leapfrogging each other, so too can
new societies with One Commandments combine moral and technological innovation
to genuinely progress beyond our status quo.
Recentralization is not about going full circle and making zero progress. It’s the helical
theory of history. Recentralization, done right, is a cycle back to centralization from
one vantage point but a step forward from another.
I don’t agree with him on everything, but Yuval Harari has a good quote on this:
I mean we need institutions actually more, but there is this wave of distrust
against them. Now, it doesn’t mean we need the old institutions. It doesn’t
mean that we have to stick with the old media. Maybe we need new media
institutions, which will be more diverse, which will give more people a
chance to voice their opinions, but in the end we will need to build these
institutions. The idea that we can just do without them, that we’ll have
just this free market of ideas and anybody can say anything, and we don’t
want institutions to kind of stand in the middle, and curate and decide4.7. TOWARDS A RECENTRALIZED CENTER 199
what is reliable and what is not reliable, this doesn’t work, it’s been tried
so many times in history.
You know, if you look at religious history, to take a counter example, so you
have in Christianity, again and again these people coming and saying, “you
know, we don’t want the Catholic Church, this institution, let’s just every
person can read the Bible for himself and know the truth, what is more
simple than that, why do we need an institution,” and you have the Refor-
mation, the protestant Reformation. And within twenty years or ﬁfty years,
they realize that when you let every person read the Bible for themselves
you get 100 diﬀerent interpretations, [each] radically diﬀerent.
So eventually someone comes and says “No, these are the correct interpreta-
tions” and you get the Lutheran church. And after 100 years, someone says
“wait, but the whole idea of the Reformation was to get rid of the Church
so we don’t want the Lutheran church. Let every person just read the Bible
and understand by themselves.” And you have chaos. And after 50 years,
you have the Baptist church, and this church, and that.. you always go back
to institutions. So it’s the same with the kind of information explosion that
we have right now.
Note that in this example the Protestants, and then the Lutherans, and then the
Baptists had to attractpeople to their interpretations. Many other competing de-
nominations did not. This process of constantly forking and innovating and having it
compete in the marketplace brings in new blood.
And that’s the concept of the recentralized center. The way to demonstrate it’s a step
forward is via mass exodus of people from both American Anarchy and Chinese Control
to the recentralized center, to high-trust startup societies and network states.",874
132,"5.1 Why Now?
Why now? After almost 400 years of the Westphalian nation state, why do we think
the status quo could change?
First, the status quo. What is the modern nation state, anyway? What is a nation, for
that matter? How was state formation enabled long ago by technological innovations
like mapmaking and print capitalism? When did the political events transpire that led
to the rise of the nation state? And what were the historical alternatives?
Then, thechange. Whatarethecontemporarycatalysts, thetechnologicalandpolitical

133,"5.2 On Nation States
You may think you know what a nation state is, but you probably haven’t given it
much thought. Poke on the abstraction a bit, and fun ensues. You start realizing how
diﬀerent the nation is from the state, how tricky it is to determine who qualiﬁes as a
“nation,” how confusing our modern terminology around this topic is, and how many
other modes of human organization represent potential competitors to the nation state.
That exploration opens the door to the network state.
In the process, you’ll encounter all those philosophers people vaguely recall from school.
You know, Locke and Rousseau, Plato and Aristotle, the subjects of countless boring
book reports — many of them make a showing in this chapter. But their presence
here is diﬀerent from the typical dryasdust college lecture, because the network state
makes political science an appliedscience, more like political technology. You are
listening with intent to repeat. That is, just like cryptocurrencies gave people other
2005.2. ON NATION STATES 201
than the Fed Chair a reason to learn about everything from seignorage to demurrage,
cryptocountries give people other than the Founding Fathers the ability to put political
theory into political practice.
But only if you understand that theory, so let’s dive in.",298
134,"5.2.1 What is a Nation State?
The most obvious deﬁnition is that a nation state is a geographic region of the world
ruled by a group of humans we call a government. It’s what we talk about when we
refer to “countries” like the United States of America and the People’s Republic of
China. It’s a ﬂag-labeled region on a political map of the globe.
Britannica provides a more precise deﬁnition, namely that a nation state is a “territo-
rially bounded sovereign polity” that is “ruled in the name of a community of citizens
that identify themselves as a nation.” And that latter bit is key, because a nation state
is notjusta government that controls a territory. It’s supposed to be a government
thatrepresents a distinct people, a nation.",206
135,"5.2.2 What is the Nation State System?
There’s an excellent passage from Joshua Keating in his book Invisible Countries on
the peculiarity of the nation state system. He analogizes the system to a selective club
with the following eight rules:
•Rule 1: A country is a territory deﬁned by borders mutually agreed
upon by all countries.
•Rule 2: A country must have a state that controls (or at least seeks
to control) the legitimate use of force within its territory, and a pop-
ulation of citizens.
•Rule 3: Every spot on the earth’s landmass must be occupied by a
country.
•Rule 4: Every person on the planet must be a citizen of at least one
country.
•Rule 5: On paper, all countries have the same legal standing—Tuvalu
has just as much right to its countryhood as China, Somalia just as
much as Switzerland—even if they are politically and economically
highly unequal.
•Rule 6: Consent of the people within each country is preferred, but
not required. Tyranny or de facto anarchy within a country is not
grounds for loss of club membership.
•Rule 7: Under some circumstances, one or more countries may invade
oroccupyanothercountry,butnoteliminateitscountryhoodorredraw202 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
its borders.
•Rule 8: The currently existing set of countries and the borders be-
tween them should be left in place whenever possible—that is, the
club prefers not to admit new members.
Keating goes on to note that the rules of this club are backed by the institutions of
the UN and the military force of the US, and that the agreement of billions of people
through their governments on the current world order is what preserves “cartographic
stasis.”
Note that even if one thinks of the UN as ineﬀectual, it’s a Schelling Point for the
system. Nothing else has as much legitimacy, as many backlinks.
Assumptions of the Nation State System
We can describe the assumptions of the nation state system in a diﬀerent lens, one
that makes it easier to understand the diﬀerences between this system and the network
state system we will introduce in the following pages:
•Physical ﬁrst. The physical map of the world is primary.
•Composition . In theory, a nation state is composed of a single nation (the people)
and an administrative entity (the state). In practice, some “nation states” are
really multinational empires, while some nations are stateless nations.
•No terra incognita. The modern nation state system takes for granted that there
is noterra incognita : that the map of the physical world is fully known, such that
it can be subdivided.
•No terra nullius. The system also takes for granted that there’s no terra nullius ,
no unclaimed land. With few exceptions, every piece of land on the surface of
the earth is spoken for by one and only one state. Much of the ocean is likewise
split up this way, aside from international waters.
•Top-down division of land. The fully visible map is carved into geographical
regions called states, with borders precisely demarcated by latitudes and longi-
tudes.
•One state per citizen. People are typically citizens of just one state, changing
citizenship is infrequent, and most citizens are governed by the same state as
their parents. The primary method of citizenship is still jus sanguinis , by birth.
•Legitimacy from physical control and electoral choice. A nation state’s legitimacy
comes from a few sources. First, the state needs to be good enough at violence to
actually control the territory it claims. Second, but really secondarily, the state
is supposedly legitimized by the support of their underlying nation and their
demonstrated respect for universal human rights. (It’s unfortunately a secondary
point because any group that is in de facto control of territory for long enough5.2. ON NATION STATES 203
eventually gets recognized.) Ideally, a legitimate state reﬂects the will of its
people while also respecting the rights of the individual – giving voice to the
masses and the minority alike.
•Centralized administration. The administrators of the state, frequently an exec-
utive and a legislature, write laws on paper to specify what is mandatory and
forbidden. These laws are typically interpreted by a judiciary and enforced by
men with guns. And in the nation state system, every piece of land is adminis-
tered by exactly one state, regardless of who is on it.
•Domestic monopoly of violence. Eachstatekeepsorderwithinitsbordersthrough
apoliceforce. Citizenswhodefythelawaresubjecttoincreasinglevelsofviolence
until they comply, as per Grand Theft Auto .
•International sovereignty via military. In principle, states aren’t supposed to
interfere with the domestic aﬀairs of other states. In practice, a state only main-
tains sovereignty if it is competent enough in defending against domestic and
foreign rivals alike, via its police, intelligence agencies, and military.
•Diplomatic recognition via bilateral and multilateral fora. States may sign bilat-
eral agreements with each other, or they may be recognized by multilateral fora
like the UN, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), and the G-20. Diplomatic recognition is a matter of both politics
and paperwork, and the lack of recognition can isolate a state and/or its citizens.
•Treaties manage cooperation and constraint. A set of cross-border compacts at-
tempt to govern interstate interaction and limit abuses, promising things like hu-
man rights and freedom of movement — declarations that are frequently ﬂouted.
•Pax Americana. Finally, while it was not always so, the guarantor of the cur-
rent nation state system is the USA, which is where the UN is headquartered,
and which purports to “provide global leadership” and “champion the rules-based
international order.” All other states must hope that this guarantor of the rules-
based order doesn’t decide to invade, surveil, sanction, strafe, or otherwise desta-
bilize them.
These cover the six essential parts of the state: borders, population, central govern-
ment, international sovereignty, diplomatic recognition, and the domestic monopoly on
violence.",1448
136,"5.2.3 The Nation State as a Term
Understanding the term “nation state” requires us to distinguish the nation (a group
of people with common descent, history, culture, or language) from the state (their
government). They are not the same.
Even though “nation” is often conﬂated with “state,” the term “nation state” has two
wordsforareason. Theﬁrstword( nation)hasthesameetymologicalrootas“natality.”204 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
It once denoted a group of people with shared ancestry. The second word ( state) refers
to the entity that governs these people, that commands the police and the military, and
that holds the monopoly of violence over the geographic area that the nation inhabits.
In a sense, the nation and the state are as diﬀerent as labor and management in a
factory. The former are the masses and the latter are the elite.
The textbook nation state is something like Japan, in which a single group with shared
ancestry and culture (the Japanese) occupies a clearly delineated territory (the islands
of Japan) and is ruled by a clear sovereign (the Japanese government) which is repre-
sentative of the people in some sense (originally via the divine, contemporaneously via
the Diet).",308
137,"5.2.4 Micronations and Multinations
This gives us a new perspective on why micronations like Sealand don’t work: they
start backwards, from the territory and the government, rather than working forwards
from a people and their culture. The latter process is how nation states historically
emerged: a state was set up by a nation to govern it, not vice versa...though then that
self-same state often began the process of assimilating others into its founding nation,
so it was a bidirectional process.
Bidirectionalitynotwithstanding, theeggofthenationprecedesthechickenofthestate.
From this perspective, a better term than micronation is really microstate, because it’s
not a micro- nationunless it represents a small groupof aligned people. A single person
self-proclaiming a government is just a tiny state. As the saying goes, you and what
army? Without a nation, there is no army - and no legitimacy.
Ontheothersideofthespectrumisanempire, ormultination. TheRomanEmpire, the
Ottoman Empire, and the Soviet Empire contained many nations and ethnic groups.
This vantage point allows us to rectify more vocabulary. The concept of a multi-
national corporation, for example, is something of a misnomer; the right term is a
multi-statecorporation (which operates across polities), as opposed to a multi- national
state (which manages the aﬀairs of many diﬀerent ethnic groups within its boundaries).",340
138,"5.2.5 0-nation, 1-nation, N-nations
In between 0-nation microstates and N-nation empires are 1-nation states, governments
thataresetuptomanagetheaﬀairsofasingleethnicgroupinadeﬁnedterritory. How-
ever, while this kind of terminology is not exactly deprecated , it’s a bit old-fashioned.
It’s not how we tend to talk about nation states in the current year.5.2. ON NATION STATES 205
First, today we often discuss multiethnic states — multinations, like the USA — which
are really more like the empires of yore than a classical monoethnic nation state. Sec-
ond, many contend that physical borders don’t matter in the age of the internet. Third,
modern discourse focuses to a much greater extent on proposition nations , where shared
ideas are the organizing principle rather than shared inheritance. Fourth, and most
importantly, conﬂict between ethnic groups within states can result in civil war, mass
deportation, totalitarian brainwashing, ethnic cleansing, forced conversion, and cul-
tural destruction, the kind of process that recently resulted in the formations of East
Timor and South Sudan.
Later, we’ll talk about how network states address these issues, but these are the (un-
derstandable!) reasons why the distinction between the nationand thestatehas fallen
out of favor. Scholars don’t want to inadvertently encourage separatism or irredentism
or worse, lest people think it’s not a realnation state unless the political entity (the
state) represents all the members of a single ethnicity (the nation) in all the lands
around the world where they preponderate.
Or at least, they don’t want to do so domestically. Because the average American is
a bit schizophrenic when it comes to terminology like this. He can easily understand
the desire of, say, the Ukrainian people to break free of the Russian empire, or for the
Tibetan nation to have their own government separate from the Chinese state, or for
the Persian people to distinguish themselves from the theocracy of Iran. But the same
person is typically more skeptical that Britain should have exited the European Union,
let alone that the “Texan nation” should have its own sovereign state.
Thecynicalmightsaythatnationalaspirationsgetairtimeinproportiontothenational
interest; themorecynicalmightsaythateventheterm“nationalinterest” isyetanother
misnomer, because it’s more like the “state’s interest” given that the American state
rules more than one nation. This, however, leads us to the key question of what exactly
constitutes a nation.",617
139,"5.2.6 What is a Nation?
This question was once all-important: what groups are signiﬁcant enough to be called
nations, candidates for a state of their own? It will soon be all-important again, as
important as “what is a currency,” and for similar reasons: because Bitcoin, web3, the
metaverse, remote work, mobile, and the internet allow people to exit legacy arrange-
ments and form new groups more easily than at any time in the recent past. But which
of these groups should be considered a “nation”?
A Deﬁnitional Approach
Let’s start with Oxford’s deﬁnition by way of their free service Lexico:
A large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or
language, inhabiting a particular country or territory.206 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
From that deﬁnition, we can extract the following properties:
•A large body of people : has to be of a substantial size (10-100k+?)
•united: members see themselves as being part of the same group.
•common descent : shared genetics, have intermarried more with each other than
people outside the nation.
•(or) history : shared past, have lived near each other for some time.
•(or) culture : shared dress, food, mannerisms, religion, and/or customs.
•(or) language : shared spoken and/or written tongue.
•inhabiting a particular...territory : found in a speciﬁc region of the globe.
Each of these pieces can be poked at. How large is “large”? How do we measure whether
a group of people is united? How localized to a particular territory does a nation have
to be, or can it be nomadic? And why do we have a complex “OR” statement buried
in the middle, where common descent, history, culture, orlanguage all ﬁgure in? Our
ﬁrst instinct is that the deﬁnition of a nation is a little fuzzy, and our instinct is right.
An Empirical Approach
To ground our discussion, let’s go through speciﬁc examples of groups that have been
called nations:
•The Japanese : They line up with the deﬁnition perfectly. The Japanese at one
point did have quite an empire, and there is a Japanese diaspora in the US
(and Brazil)...but most people of Japanese ancestry live on the islands of Japan,
speak the Japanese language, are governed by the Japanese state, and live in an
essentially monoethnic polity.
•The Spanish : They have a nation state today, but in the past they had an
international empire that then contracted, leaving them mostly to themselves
on the Iberian Peninsula. They left behind a global footprint in the form of 20
countries that speak Spanish, yet do not consider themselves part of the Spanish
nation state.
•The Turks : They are a multiethnic state today that is also the successor to an
even larger empire, the Ottoman Empire, with a deﬁnitionally Byzantine history.
•The Israelis : Theirstatusasanationstatechangedwithtime. TheJewishpeople
were once a stateless nation, a diasporic group united by common ancestry and
tradition without a land or government to call their own. Then, within living
memory, they founded the state of Israel. (Herzl’s work is a major inspiration for
this book.)
•The Catalonians, the Kurds, and the Palestinians : Of course, for every Spain,
Israel, or Turkey, there is a Catalonia, a Palestine, a Kurdistan — namely a group5.2. ON NATION STATES 207
that self-identiﬁes as a nation and feels its national aspirations have been denied.
These are stateless nations , as distinct from nation states, without necessarily
endorsing any particular cause.
•The Irish : They now have an independent Ireland, but famously didn’t for many
years under the British. A controversial issue is whether Northern Ireland should
be part of the Republic of Ireland, or part of the UK.
•The Taiwanese : This group is recognized as a nation by some parties but by no
means all. We can think of these as partially sovereign nations , with a measure
of control over their own state and territory, but less than they’d like.
•The Americans, the Singaporeans, and the French : These states have tried, with
varying success, to craft a common identity as a “nation” from the raw material of
several diﬀerent ethnic groups. Indeed, the Americans have, by some measures,
been very successful in this eﬀort — at least for a time. The Americans, the
Singaporeans, and the French are explicitly proposition nations.
•The Chinese and the Indians : These gigastates are not really single-nation states
given the sheer multiplicity of diﬀerent groups within each country’s borders.
However, those diﬀerent groups didn’t all recently arrive next to each other like a
BurningManencampment. They’vebeenlivingalongsideeachotherforcenturies
in a common civilization, with greater and lesser levels of past uniﬁcation, so
the grouping is more “Lindy” than more recent multiethnic states with less of a
long-term track record, let alone the wholly arbitrary states left in the wake of
colonialism. Some have used the term civilization state for these entities. You
might even stretch this to encompass the European Union, though it is more of a
transnational bureaucracy than an entity that celebrates European civilization.
And for many Middle Eastern and African countries, the states don’t really reﬂect the
underlying nations at all. A clue here is the presence of horizontal or vertical lines
on a map, lines that don’t reﬂect the organic physical (deserts, mountains, rivers) and
cultural (languages, marriages, religions) barriers that help deﬁne nations. Many of
these “imposed states” are a parting gift from colonial empires.
From these examples, we can already see quite a bit of variation:
•nationswithstates (Japanese, Spanish)
•nationswithoutstates (Kurds, Catalonians)
•nations with partially sovereign states (Taiwan)
•multiethnic states that are trying to create proposition nations (America, Singa-
pore, France)
•imposedmultiethnicstatesthatdon’tevenhaveapropositiontobindthem(many
“states” formed as shotgun marriages in the aftermath of European colonialism)208 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
•civilization states that are multiethnic, but have long-standing cultural ties that
unify their constituent nations (China, India)
Just by touring this topic, we also see that the issue of “what is a nation” is still the hot
button, the third rail, the pulse raiser, the argument starter. Because a nation granted
legitimacy can claim territory and erect a polity, while a nation denied recognition
remains landless and stateless, the stakes couldn’t be higher for this seemingly abstract
question.
A Philosophical Approach
We just did some speciﬁc examples. Can we enunciate general principles that deﬁne
which groups should be considered bona ﬁde nations? Many scholars from the past to
the recent present have taken a crack at this question.
Here’sanecessarilyincompleteprécisoftheirviews,takeninpartfromBenner’schapter
here and Kaufmann’s review here. First, the thinkers of the late 1700s and 1800s,
writing during the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, or the Revolutions of
1848:
•Rousseau : if a group of people voluntarily consents to being bound by the same
governing authority, they are a nation.
•Marx: a nation is a convenient group supported by a Great Power to destabilize
a rival. Regarding communism, the nation is a group to lead to acquire political
supremacy and a boundary to transcend to unite the proletariat.
•Locke: if two groups lay claim to the same territory, the more “rational and
industrious” should be considered a nation.
•John Stuart Mill : if a group consents to the same governing authority, and is
capable of attaining control over a piece of land, they should be considered a
nation. Mill’s concept of utility, however, trumps consent.
•Hegel: a nation is formed by its institutions imbuing a sense of shared ethics.
War tests that ethical duty and is not inherently evil, but a natural condition of
anarchic interstate relations.
•JG Herder",1994
140,": If a group shares language and descent, it is a nation, a concept
known as primordialism. Moreover, small nations should be independent from
larger nations that want to assimilate them into diﬀerent languages.
•JG Fichte : likeHerder, separatelanguagesandethnicitiesdeﬁneseparatenations.
Moreover, a state can build a nation through education, guiding the populace
towards a shared cultural and linguistic identity.
•Ernest Renan : a nation is those with “common glories” and sacriﬁces in the
past and “the will to continue them in the present.” The existence of a nation5.2. ON NATION STATES 209
is represented by a “daily plebiscite” that constitutes the present consent of a
people.
•Ernest Gellner : nations are peoples sharing (via schooling) language, culture,
and forms of communication particularly adapted to modern society.
•Benedict Anderson : nations are just social constructs, imagined communities,
based on linguistic connections driven by “print capitalism.”
•Eric Hobsbawm : nations must have a historic association with a current state,
a long-established linguocultural administrative elite, and a proven capacity for
conquest.
These deﬁnitions both overlap and conﬂict. Some tensions include:
•Primordialism vs propositionism. A nation can be a group with shared ancestry,
culture, and language, but it can also be based purely on ideas and voluntary
association.
•Scale vs uniqueness. A nation needs suﬃcient scale to be able to defend itself, so
it should adopt a broad deﬁnition of national membership. But it needs to also
avoid becoming so assimilated into a large-scale group that there’s no distinct
culture to defend.
•Self-determination vs external sponsorship. A nation is based in part on self-
identiﬁcation as a nation, but in practice needs to also be capable of delivering
real world results (being “rational and industrious”) and of attracting the support
of a Great Power patron.
•Imagined communities vs real linguocultural ties. A nation is an imagined com-
munity and a social construct, but it needs to share enough of the same language
and culture to feasibly assemble that construct.
These divergences mean there isn’t yet a single test for whether a group is a nation,
though one can make a more or less persuasive case in any given instance by appealing
to diﬀerent standards. However, with modern tools, we might be able to tidy up that
fuzziness. Later in this chapter, we’ll introduce a computational approach to deﬁning
a nation that complements the empirical and philosophical approaches. And we’ll talk
abouthowthesetheoriesofnationalorigininﬂuenceastartupsocietyfounder’sstrategy
for “customer acquisition,” or in this case citizen acquisition.
But for now, what is a nation? Perhaps it’s just a group that can convince enough
other people that it’s a nation.",714
141,"5.2.7 What is a State?
It’s also worth spending time on the other half of the nation state deﬁnition: what
exactly is a state?210 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
The Deﬁnitional Approach
This helpful video enumerates six properties of a state:
1.Border: a clearly deﬁned territory
2.Population : one or more nations that live within that territory
3.Central government : the ability to create laws
4.Interstate sovereignty : in theory, control over domestic aﬀairs without interfer-
ence by other states
5.Recognition : diplomatic recognition by other states
6.Domestic monopoly on violence : the ability to maintain order inside the territory
A failed state in the midst of civil war wouldn’t ﬁt, for example, because it wouldn’t
be able to prevent foreign powers from interfering (item 4), nor would it be able to
control violence domestically (item 6). A micronation doesn’t count because it lacks
territory (item 1) and population (item 2). And an administrative subdivision of the
US like Arkansas also wouldn’t count, because it lacks recognition by foreign states
(item 5) and control relative to Washington, D.C. (item 3). However, a subdivision
can sometimes becomean independent state.
The Comparative Approach
How about a comparison? Precisely because they’re so often conﬂated, it’s worth
addressing in detail just how a state diﬀers from a nation.
•The state is a political and legal entity, while a nation is a cultural, ethnic, and
psychological identity.
•The state is bound by laws and threat of force, while a nation is bound by
sentiments and linguistic/genetic/cultural alignment.
•The state is top-down and hierarchical, while the nation is bottom-up and peer-
to-peer.
•And, as above, the state has a ﬁxed territory, a government and sovereignty over
a territory, while a nation typically has shared language, culture, and/or ancestry.
Nations may not always have a single state. The Kurds lack a state, while the Koreans
are split into two states. Conversely, states may govern one or more nations. The
British state governs the English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish nations, while the Soviet
state governed more than 100 diﬀerent nationalities.
While some contend that the distinction between nation and state is an intrinsically
European idea, there are actually diﬀerent words for these concepts across languages.5.2. ON NATION STATES 211
The Pragmatic Approach
Perhaps the simplest test for whether something is a bona ﬁde state is whether it’s a
member of the United Nations General Assembly. Does it have suﬃcient diplomatic
recognition? Is it considered a state by other entities we’d consider states? In a word,
is itrecognized ? This is important because even the very largest groups of people, like
the Chinese and the Indians, are outnumbered by the rest of the world; social viability
is necessary for state viability.
A couple of excellent books on this topic are Invisible Countries andNot on the
Map, which review edge cases like Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, Transnistria, North-
ern Cyprus, Somaliland, South Ossetia, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic,
Kosovo, and Taiwan. Each of these entities has a greater or lesser degree of internal
state-like-ness, with Taiwan being the most legit, but all of them lack some degree of
full interstate recognition — often due to a powerful regional or global opponent.
While we’re discussing the UN, a better name than the “United Nations” might be
the “Selected States.” After all, many stateless nations don’t have a seat in the United
NationsGeneralAssembly, liketheKurds, theCatalonians, ortheTibetans. Andmany
countries that dohave seats are more akin to multinational empires than single-nation
states.
The Philosophical Approach
Keynes said “Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any in-
tellectual inﬂuences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.” Meaning, if
you don’t know what intellectual software you’re running, you’re probably running it
unconsciously. So, it’s hard to survey the many thinkers that led to the modern state,
because we don’t always understand the full scope of their impact.
We’ll try anyway. Here’s another necessarily imprecise set of summaries of what dif-
ferent political theorists thought about the state.
•Plato: the state should make possible the conditions under which everyone can
provide for themselves and seek the Good.
•Aristotle: all communities aim at some good, and the state is the highest kind of
community, aiming at the highest of goods.
•Locke: The state is legitimate if it enforces contracts and acts as the guarantor
of private property.
•Carlyle: The state should be run by a hero that provides order.
•Schmitt: The state embodies a clear friend-enemy distinction.
•Marx: The state is meant to organize the proletariat against the ruling class.
•Keynes: The state should intervene to smooth the business cycle and support full
employment.212 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
•Rawls: The state distributes social goods and economic opportunities equally to
its free citizens according to the theory of justice as fairness.
•Hobbes: The state possess absolute authority, and this powerful Leviathan makes
anti-social men behave in pro-social ways.
•Rousseau : The state is legitimate if people have consented to a “Social Contract”
in which they self-rule and ideally do not abdicate sovereignty to potentially
disaligned representatives.
•Samuelson : The state is meant to provide public goods that private actors would
not be able to supply.
•Lee Kuan Yew : The state should provide its people with the maximum enjoyment
of freedoms and respect the family unit. The state should embrace multiple
nations yet demand loyalty.
Statecraft Strategies and Programming Paradigms
Again, this isn’t just desiccated theory. It’s important to understand these ideas be-
cause they are used implicitly or explicitly by the founders and leaders of actually
existing states.
From a computer science standpoint, these schools of thought are statecraft strategies
that are analogous to programming paradigms. That is, you can often solve the same
problem from (say) an object-oriented, functional, or imperative standpoint. But cer-
tain problems are easier to tackle with a particular paradigm, while others become
much harder.
So too for these varying theories of the state. Moreover, rather than being used in
isolation, these statecraft strategies are often fused within a single legal codebase, much
as diﬀerent programming paradigms can complement each other within a company’s
codebase.
For example, Karl Marx’s zero-sum worldview made it easy to justify a Soviet state
withamassiveRedArmytodestroythecapitalistoppressors. Jean-JacquesRousseau’s
writingbycontrastdidn’tgivemuchjustiﬁcationfortheuseofforceitself, butfurnished
a vision of consensual communistic utopia that sat just on the other side of the Red
Army’s liberating violence. Carl Schmitt and Thomas Carlyle are a roughly equivalent
pairing on the right, with Schmitt advocating that a hero use state force against the
enemy and Carlyle talking up the bounteous order that would arise as a result.
Marx and Rousseau’s failure mode was their departure from economic reality, as they
didn’t take into account self-interest. Schmitt and Carlyle’s failure mode was their
departure from political reality, as they didn’t take into account the interests of the
other guy. But their statecraft strategies were once inﬂuential enough to drive some
of the most powerful states in world history, so we need to understand them, even if
we must also discard them. Think about how PHP is a programming language that5.2. ON NATION STATES 213
“sucks” according to many engineers, yet somehow led to many of the most popular
apps of all time (Facebook, WordPress, Slack, etc), and you’ll get the point.
It is also possible to run completely in another direction, and have a purely contractual
state run on an implicitly Hayekian/Lockean paradigm, maximizing some measure of
wealth without any of the meaning that the Marxist or Schmittian state narratives
provide. That also has its vulnerabilities, as a vacuum of meaning can be ﬁlled by",1991
142,"a rival whose statecraft strategy involves constant evangelism; this is why the Pla-
tonic/Aristotlean state narratives have a good point when they prioritize purpose.
Thestrengthsandweaknessesofvariousstatecraftstrategiescanbediscussedatlength,
and we’ll return to this topic. But for now: before you design your ideal state, you
should have some idea of what others thought their ideal state to be, and how that
worked out.",105
143,"5.2.8 What does a Nation State look like on a Map?
The simple answer is that a nation state is a colored blob on a map. But we can think
of that map as a superposition of various underlying maps showing where members of
the nation are located — for example, where the speakers of the language, those with
shared alleles, and those with similar culture reside, overlaid on the legal boundaries
of the state).
Again, Japanisourcanonicalexample. Theunderlyingmapsalllineup. Mostspeakers
of the Japanese language, most people with Japanese ancestry, most holders of the
Japanese yen, most practitioners of Shintoism, and most people who are culturally
Japanese live in the islands of Japan administered by the Japanese government.
Other nations are much messier than that.
•Some nations have spread fractally around a territory, as in the Balkans.
•Some nations have spread around the world, as did the Jewish community pre-
Israel (still true to a signiﬁcant extent today).
•Some previously uniﬁed nations have been split between territories for historical
reasons, as are North and South Korea.
•Other nations are deﬁned by multiple overlapping maps, because one variable
alone is not enough to delimit them. For example, if you just said that all people
who speak Spanish are members of the Spanish nation, you would misclassify
millions of people across continents who do not think of themselves as part of the
same community.
•Some “nation states,” like Indonesia, have odd-looking boundaries — in part,
because they are really multinational states.
•Some “nation states,” like France and the United Kingdom, have surprisingly
distributed global footprints because they are really the remains of multinational214 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
empires.
In general, the idealized nation state is one where the members of a given group —
the nation — are physically centralized within a single bounded set on the surface of
the globe. That may seem trivial, but later in this chapter we’ll explore physically
decentralized polities in the context of network states.",475
144,"5.2.9 How were Modern Nation States Founded?
There are a few diﬀerent angles on the question of how nation states get founded.
The Historical Angle
The ﬁrst angle is to think about when many states were founded on roughly the same
principles at the same time. We can deﬁne a few critical moments in history.
•WW2 and Cold War (1945-1991) : today’s states were founded under the aegis
of the postwar order. After World War II, within Europe large-scale population
transfers created monoethnic states. Meanwhile, outside Europe, the colonies
owned by Western European powers experienced “decolonization” and then ar-
guably “recolonization” by the USSR or USA respectively in the name of commu-
nism or capitalism. Another clutch of independent states arose after the collapse
of the USSR in 1991.
•American Revolution, French Revolution, Great Divergence (1776-1800s) : Writ-
ers like Benedict Anderson date the rise of European nationalism in its modern
sense to the “Great Divergence” of the early 1800s, after the French Revolution,
which was in turn inspired by the American Revolution.
•30 Years War, Spanish/Dutch War, and Peace of Westphalia (1618-1648) : The
Peace of Westphalia ended the 30 Years War between Protestants and Catholics
that had been kicked oﬀ by the Reformation, and ushered in the concept of states
with bounded territorial sovereignty as opposed to the unbounded authority of
the Catholic Church.
•Rise of mapmaking and print capitalism (1500s) : The rise of mapmaking tech-
nologies enabled the creation of accurate maps. We take this for granted today,
but without good maps there were no explicit borders beyond terrain, only grad-
ual diminishment of the power of one sovereign as its territory bled into that of
another.
•Ancient era. Civilization states like China and India date their origins back to
antiquity, and can point to certain continuities of language, culture, and religious
practice.
•Prehistory. Primordialists argue that the nations that underpin states predate
written history, as their linguistic, genetic, and cultural bonds stretch back thou-
sands of years. In other words, nations are naturally occurring phenomena, more5.2. ON NATION STATES 215
like the periodic table of the elements than a social construct, with boundaries
that are obvious in a Potterian sense. Any real modern nation state was in this
sense founded millennia ago.
Importantly, the whole world didn’t get modern nation states at the same time. For
example, Westphalian sovereignty was initially established withinWestern Europe, but
not outside it. European nation states were supposed to honor each others’ borders, in
principle at least, so they went abroad to conquer other places.
But these junction points in history are still useful ways to think about the founding of
nation states, with one or the other looming larger depending on whether one is more
focused on the “nation,” the “state,” or the “nation state” combination.
From a practical standpoint, clearly you can’t found a civilization state like China or
India without thousands of years of history. But you might be able to distill a new
“nation” like the Mormons (est: 1830) from the mass of Americans, or alternatively
architect an impressive new nation state like “E”-stonia (est: 1991) from the same
nation oppressed by the dreary Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.
The Patronage Angle
An alternative approach is to look at the details of how speciﬁc nation states were
founded. One thing that pops out to us when studying enough of these histories is that
national independence is not solely a matter of self-determination, because the fate of
many nations is not determined wholly by their own eﬀorts.
For example, the Soviets were “anti-imperialist” when that meant getting Western-
sympathetic capitalists out, and Soviet-sympathetic communists in. The French sup-
ported the ﬂedgling American nation when that meant poking a thumb in the eye of
their British rivals. And today’s Americans haven’t been too vocal on the Kurds or
Yemenis given their alliances with the Turkish and Saudi states, but are extremely
enthusiastic about the Ukrainians, Taiwanese, and Uighurs given their conﬂicts with
the Russian and Chinese states.
As such, to achieve its ambitions a stateless nation may also need a patron, a kind of
venture capitalist Great Power. Self-determination is not enough.
The Military Angle
Many countries were founded within living memory, but because they were often
founded by force, some don’t believe it’s possible to found new countries withoutforce.
Or is it? They say you cannot found a Pentagon; they don’tsay you can’t found a
competitor to the post oﬃce, or the taxi medallion system, or to NASA. They instead
go right to the thing where we don’t have comparably recent foundings...or do we?
After all, the Pentagon itself was built by human beings just like you and me in 1943.
India, Israel, and Singapore were likewise founded in 1947, 1948, and 1965 respectively,
and have their own defense department equivalents.216 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
Of course, there are other interpretations of this challenge. It could mean “OK, it
happenedawhileago, butIdon’tthinkthePentagon-formingprocesscanberepeated,”
orperhaps“Itwouldbebadtoraiseamassivenewarmy,asthatwouldbedestabilizing,”
or even, “Come on, you can’t found the most powerful military in the world from
scratch.” But answering these kinds of questions presents an embedded Catch-22.
Either someone thinking about starting new countries must want to create a powerful
new military (dangerous!) or else they don’t have any guns and will get crushed by
those that do (dangerously naive).
One answer is that you don’t need to get full sovereignty but can instead contract
with an existing sovereign for defense. In fact, this is that this is actually what most
“real” countries already do — few truly have full sovereignty, as most contract out their
defense in a similar manner way to the US or (nowadays) China.
Another answer is that you could write a book just on this (and perhaps we’ll need to
add another chapter), but for a fundamentally digital entity with physical decentral-
ization around the world, the primary mode will be nonviolent digital defense through
secrecy, pseudonymity, decentralization, and encryption. In diﬀerent ways, Google and
Bitcoin protect many millions of people’s digital footprint without an enormous army.",1548
145,"5.2.10 Why were Nation States Founded?
Another way of asking this is: what came before the nation state?
The short answer is that people had diﬀerent identity stacks. In Europe, the populace
didn’t think of themselves as all being primarily “French” or “German” till much later
on. They instead thought of themselves on the basis of their feudal lord or region
(Brittany, Prussia) or religion ( e.g., Protestant/Catholic). Transnational entities like
the Catholic Church also claimed dominion over all believers, no matter where they
might be, so there was a question as to whether Pope or King had ultimate authority
in any given jurisdiction. Wars ensued.
The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 resolved these issues and is considered by many to
be the origin of the European nation state. The Westphalian peace divided territory
by lines on a map. Over each territory thus delineated, there was a government that
represented the people in that territory, with the right to exercise force on their behalf.
And these “sovereign” states were supposed to leave each other alone.
In theory, the state was meant to be an innovation in violence reduction. You stay
in your lane, I stay in mine. Clear sovereigns would keep domestic order, and the
principle of national sovereignty would deter aggression from abroad. It didn’t entirely
work out like that, of course; both intrastate and interstate conﬂict still occurred. But
the abstraction of nation states may still have been preferable to the preceding era of
fuzzy bordered empires and conﬂicting sovereigns.5.2. ON NATION STATES 217",372
146,"5.2.11 How does a Nation State Expand and Contract?
There are at least four ways a nation state expands:
•Demographically. By reproduction or immigration. A nation grows when it sees
more birth than death. A state grows when one of its constituent nations expe-
riences demographic growth, or when it adds immigrants, which may be from a
diﬀerent nation. Note that there can be a diﬀerence here between expansion of
the state and the nation!
•Geographically. By conquest ( e.g., Ivan the Terrible’s expansion of Russia), by
acquisition ( e.g., the Louisiana Purchase), or by agreement ( e.g., Singapore’s
involuntary separation from Malaysia).
•Economically. By trade and opening of markets. This is not always peaceful: see
the British East India Company, Smedley Butler, and the Opium Wars.
•Ideologically. By education and conversion. Revolutionary France invested heav-
ily in educating all citizens to speak French, expanding the self-identiﬁed French
nation. Similarly, Christian, Muslim, and Communist groups spent immense ef-
fort on evangelism. Of course, while some of this evangelism grows the support
base of a nation state (like Maoism did for the PRC and arguably Wahhabism
did for Saudi Arabia), other kinds of viral ideas cut across the boundaries of state
and nation alike in destabilizing ways.",317
147,"5.2.12 How did States Inﬂuence Nations, and Vice Versa?
Nation state formation is bidirectional; nations create states which inﬂuence nations,
and so on. While a nation must come ﬁrst, many of history’s most successful nation
states drew adjacent (and then non-adjacent) people into the founding population by
means ranging from cultural appeal to rape and pillage.
Prior to Garibaldi, only about 2.5% of “Italians” spoke what we now know as Ital-
ian, but what was then the Florentine dialect of Italian. Similarly, before the French
Revolution, less than 50% of France spoke today’s oﬃcial variety of French. And un-
til Bismarck’s uniﬁcation of Germany, there was rivalry between Prussia and Austria
(“German dualism”) for exactly how and whether a “Germany” should be formed.
A related phenomenon is the feedback loop between political borders and national
culture. The 38th parallel didn’t have pre-existing historical signiﬁcance in Korean
culture, but after the Korean War the rate of intermarriage between the new “North
Korean” and “South Korean” groups plummeted. This state of aﬀairs has persisted for
70 years; the longer it continues, the larger the cultural gap between the two groups.
Hard political boundaries of this kind serve much the same purpose as natural physical
boundaries in the past like rivers, mountains, and deserts. They impede allelic and
cultural diﬀusion, and thus contribute to nation-forming dynamics. There’s a feedback
loop between the political/territorial and the linguistic/genetic/cultural.218 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES",413
148,"5.2.13 What is not a Nation State?
What is nota nation state? I don’t mean this in the trivial way that a banana is not
a nation state. I mean, what is another large-scale way of organizing people in the
physical world that is not a nation state?
Put another way, to understand what something is, we need to understand what it
is not. We live in a world of nation states, so conceptualizing something diﬀerent is
diﬃcult. The ideal counterexamples are things that are close, but not quite there. Here
are a few:
1.Multiethnic empires like the Soviet Union were not traditional nation states be-
cause they had more than one nationality within their boundaries.
2.Stateless nations like the Kurds are not nation states because they lack a formally
recognized territory and government.
3.Transnational movements like the Catholic Church are not nation states because
thesetofallbelieversisnotcontainedwithinaterritorialstatethatitadministers.
(The Church does have Vatican City, but that is about as ceremonial as the
British Royal Family.)
4.Terrorist groups like ISIS which operate across borders and have seized territory
at times aren’t considered states because they lack diplomatic recognition (due to
their heinous crimes!). That said, the Soviet Communists were the ISIS of their
day, and they just had to hold out 16 years for FDR to recognize them, so with
enough persistence this designation can change.
5.Nomadic tribes like the Romani and Masai are not nation states, because they
migrate between countries. Indeed, most of humanity used to live like this, with
farming/soldiering being a relatively recent innovation, and we may return to
something like it with the advent of digital nomadism.
6.Multijurisdictional corporations like Google have more people on their servers
than most countries, and do control huge chunks of their users’ lives, such as
their messages and balances. However, they are a transitional form towards our
concept of the network state, as their users lack the national consciousness of a
nation and their governance lacks the qualities we’ve come to expect from a state.
7.Ethnic diasporas like the Japanese or Armenian diasporas are not nation states.
They may have business districts, and some degree of community organization
in those regions, but they are just a tendril of a nation rather than a full nation,
and certainly lack the properties of a full state.
8.Local clans like the Pashtun and Hazara of Afghanistan are not nation states.
They are diﬀerent nations within a failed state.

149,"5.2.14 WhatTechnologicalDevelopmentsunderpintheModern

We don’t typically think of mapmaking, printing, and shooting as novel activities,
because the underlying technologies were invented so many generations ago. But they
were each foundational to our modern concept of states with borders, where men with
guns enforce written laws.
1.Mapmaking. It’s only possible to have a map of the world which we divide into
nation states if we have a map of the world. You don’t have to be a cartographic
connoisseur to know that such a map did not exist in 1492, when Columbus sailed
the ocean blue in search of an India to trade with. “Ye olde” maps with “here be
dragons” had to be painstakingly crafted. Prior to modern GPS, there was an
enormous tech stack around mapmaking, including compasses, telescopes, and
celestial navigation.
2.Printing. Not just the printing press, but the entire practice of print capitalism
helpedgiverisetothenationstate. JustasFacebookandGooglewantedeveryone
on the internet so they could expand their customer base, the new commercial
printers of the 1500s wanted everyone to speak the same language so they could
maximize sales for their goods.
3.Shooting. “God made men, but Sam Colt made them equal.” Feudalism was
enforced by horseback-riding knights in shining armor with heavy swords; guns
changed that. Others have written about the transition to the gun age, but in
short, guns reduced the importance of physical inequality. Any man (or, even-
tually, woman) with a gun could kill any other man, even if the shooter was old
and frail and the shootee was Sir Lancelot himself. The advent of ﬁrearms (and
crossbows, and cannons) destabilized the feudal hierarchy; a strong right arm was
suddenly worth less than a strong left brain, as the technology and supply chain
required to produce muskets was suddenly worth more. The gun helped catalyze
the transition from feudal hierarchy to nationalist republic and helped promote
the “republican” ideals of the American and French Revolutions.
So: a combination of mapmaking, printing, and shooting helped set the stage for the
post-Westphalian nation state, where a map delimited borders, a printed document
established the law, and a guy with a gun shot you for crossing those borders or
breaking the law.220 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES",564
150,"5.3 On Network States
The network state system starts from diﬀerent assumptions than the nation state sys-
tem (which you can review here).",34
151,"5.3.1 What is a Network State?Earlier we gave descriptions of the network state in one sentence, one thousand words,
and one essay. We also showed what a million-person version looks like on a map (see
above). Here’s that one sentence deﬁnition again:
A network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of na-
tional consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action,
anin-personlevelofcivility, anintegratedcryptocurrency, aconsensualgov-
ernment limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded
physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves
a large enough population, income, and real estate footprint to attain a
measure of diplomatic recognition.
Keep in mind that this deﬁnition references the ﬁnal form of a diplomatically recognized
network state. But you can’t get diplomatic recognition for a made-up country right
oﬀ the bat, so you can’t found a network state directly.
Instead, you found a startup society and hope to scale it into a network state that
achieves diplomatic recognition from a pre-existing government, just as you don’t found
apubliccompany directly, butinsteadfoundastartupcompanyandhopetoscaleitinto
a public company that achieves “diplomatic recognition” from a pre-existing exchange
like the NASDAQ.
Moreover, to extend the analogy, the process of scaling a startup involves waypoints -
like “seed startup,” “series B startup,” and “unicorn” - prior to achieving the status of a5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 221
public company. So too there are at least two waypoints between startup society and
network state worth noting: the network union and the network archipelago.
Turning a startup society into a network union makes it a digital community capable of
collectiveaction. Turningthatnetworkunionintoanetworkarchipelagomanifeststhat
collective action in the real world, as the community crowdfunds physical properties
around the world and connects them via the internet. Finally, an impressive enough
network archipelago can achieve diplomatic recognition from an existing government,
thereby becoming a true network state.
The Deﬁnition
That’s the process of getting to a network state. Now let’s drill into each part of our
proposed deﬁnition.
•A social network. The people of a network state form their nation online. Social
rather than geographic proximity is the core organizing principle. But this isn’t
a typical social network like Facebook or Twitter; it’s what we call a 1-network
where there is just onecoherent community present, rather than many separate
communitiesasonFacebookorTwitter. It’snotquiteacompletegraph-everyone
doesn’t have to be friends with every single other node - but it’s much closer to
that than a typical social network.
Admission to this social network is selective, people can lose their account privi-
leges for bad behavior, and everyone who’s there has explicitly opted in by apply-
ing to join. That application process could involve public proof of alignment via
writing, a career history that demonstrates common values, or the investment of
time and energy into the society to obtain digital assets. Joining the network that
underpins a network state is nota purely economic proposition, not something
that can be bought with money alone. It’s a concrete version of Rousseau’s social
contract as a literal smart contract, one that all sign before entering, a way to
turn an abstract proposition into an actual nation.
•A moral innovation. A network state grows out of a startup society that is
premised on a moral innovation, where everyone within the society thinks some
principle X is good that the rest of the world thinks is bad, or vice versa. This is
the proposition part of a proposition nation. For example, the moral innovation
could be as trivial-seeming as “sugar bad” or “24/7 internet bad”, or as heavy-
weight as “this traditional religion is good”. The moral innovation draws people
in. It gives a reason for the society to exist, a purpose that’s distinct from the
outside world, a universalist complement to the particularist sense of national
consciousness, an ideological mission that others will nod their heads at even if
they don’t share (“ok, I understand why someone might want a sugar-free society,
or a Benedict Option community”).
The reason we put such a high priority on a moral innovation is that missionary
societies outcompete mercenary ones, not just in theory but in practice. For222 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
example, the historian Paul Johnson once pointed out that the for-proﬁt colonies
in America failed but the religious ones had the cohesion and commitment to
make it through the brutal winters (see 11:00 here). We discuss this at length in
the chapter on the One Commandment.
•A sense of national consciousness. Everyone in a network state feels like they’re
part of the same community, sharing the same values and culture. They’re a
nation in the sense of Renan...“to have done great things together, to want to do
more.” Again, it’s much more like a complete graph than a typical social network,
as almost every node is friendly with a very large fraction of other nodes.
•A recognized founder. A state, like a company, needs a leader. Especially early
on. But truly strong leadership comes from consent and buy-in, not propaganda
or force. Hence, it’s important to have a recognized founder, one that people
actually listen to and choose to follow by joining the community.
Can that founder break up the Triforce, splitting their authority into some kind
of multisig? Sure, just like the founder of a startup company can choose to give
up board seats. But it’s easy to give away power and hard to consolidate it,
and you need that power sometimes to make hard but important non-consensus
decisions.That’s why dual-class stock to maintain control is used by both the
US establishment and their opponents.
As with giving up corporate board seats, giving up some power may be the right
thing to do at some point for the network state founder. But in the event that
a network state degenerates into a bureaucracy - as many mature organizations
do - a key part of the network state model is that it is, like the startup model,
built to always allow peaceful exit. Anyone can, at any time, leave to found a
new startup society and try scaling it into a network state.
•A capacity for collective action. This is tightly related to the concept of national
consciousness. It’s a combination of collective purpose (which is like the mission
statement of a company, but for a community) and the capacity to acton that
purpose.
First, let’s understand the idea of collective purpose through some examples. The
Puritanswantedtobuilda“CityonaHill.” TheJapaneseaftertheMeijiRestora-
tion replaced their previous mission statement of “Revere the Emperor, Expel the
Barbarians” with “Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Military,” turning their
society around 180 degrees and thereby building the ﬁrst non-white industrialized
power. And while the process of Indian Independence and Partition was messy
beyond belief, on the other side the collective purpose of independence uniﬁed5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 223
the Indian nation in a way it never had been before, with hundreds of so-called
“princely states” and countless ethnic groups now integrated into a single India.
As one more example, JFK once focused the US on the common purpose of
“achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon
and returning him safely to the Earth.” This was a collective purpose diﬀerent
from but allied with the also-valid zero-sum goal of defeating communism. It was
perhaps the penultimate great thing the US accomplished as a uniﬁed country,
with the defeat of the Soviet Union as the last.
These collective purposes helped unify their respective nations. They may be
imperfect, but once there’s no collective purpose at all, people start wondering
who they are. “Who are we?” That directionlessness leads to what we see in
today’s US, split into two tribes whose only “collective purpose” is to win a zero-
sum game against the other - a game each thinks it must win before being able
to move forward to the promised land.
Next, supposing we have a collective purpose, what does collective action towards",1989
152,"that purpose look like? This is why the process of building a network state
includes a network union. From the very outset it organizes people to work
together for the beneﬁt of their chosen community through the familiar interface
of their screens. This, again, is quite diﬀerent from current “social” networks
like Twitter, which give individual scores for likes and followers but no team
dashboard, no way of setting and achieving tangible goals as a group.
•An in-person level of civility. In the 90s and 2000s it was attention-getting when
people were grossly incivil to each other online, as it was a funny contrast to the
generally civil oﬄine world. Now it’s just old, and not funny anymore. Moreover,
internet ideologies have emerged that justifyrandom nastiness with slogans like
“civility is tone policing” or “toxicity is social defense.” Yet a society where ev-
eryone is constantly disrespectful to everyone else doesn’t seem like a progressive,
public-spirited society. And the conservative US of the 1950s managed to main-
tain a strong level of self-defense becausethey were internally civil. So whether
one is coming from the left or right, pulling together a high-trust society means
in-person levels of civility towards community fellow members, both oﬄine and
online. High trust in turn comes from alignment towards a collective purpose and
a sense of national consciousness.
•An integrated cryptocurrency. This is the digital backbone of the network state.
It manages the internal digital assets, the smart contracts, the web3 citizen lo-
gins, the birth and marriage certiﬁcates, the property registries, the public na-
tional statistics, and essentially every other bureaucratic process that a nation
state manages via pieces of paper. Because it’s protected by encryption, it can
coordinate all the functions of a state across the borders of legacy nation states.224 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
•An archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories. This is the physical footprint
of the network state. Rather than buying territory in one place, or trying to
negotiate sovereignty up front, you build the community in the cloud and then
crowdfund physical real estate on the earth. That’s oﬃce space, yes, but also
homes and shops - just spread all around the world in clusters, rather than con-
centrated in one place. You network these clusters together using the internet
into a network archipelago, eventually using newer technologies to make them
more real. For example, you can make the ﬂag of a network state appear to
anyone with augmented reality glasses and the right NFT, as per this visual.
You can also make doors open on command for community members, where their
ENS name is their login. The point is that a network state is nota purely digi-
tal thing. It has a substantial physical component: all the buildings around the
world crowdfunded by its members.
•A consensual government limited by a social smart contract. Now we get to
the government. Many people make the mistake of thinking the laws (or the
land) come ﬁrst when starting a new state, but laws should only come after the
formation of an organic people – of a network nation – not before. That’s because
laws encode the implicit understanding of a people. Contra the concept that you
“can’t legislate morality”, that’s all you can do: set up laws that reﬂect the moral
consensus of a people as to what is encouraged and discouraged, acceptable and
optional, mandatory and forbidden.
How is that moral consensus arrived at? It could be through a 51% democracy
(where 51% of people can outvote the other 49%) or it could be via a 100%
democracy (where 100% of people have migrated into a system and can migrate
out at any time), or it could be via one of the zillions of techniques for satisfying
preferences described in the literature.
The speciﬁcs don’t matter as much as the ethics. That is, what makes a govern-
ment legitimate is not process but substance.Given the consent of the governed,
any form of government is internally legitimate. The question is then whether it
will be considered externally legitimate, whether the world at large will accept
this government - but that is an empirical question more than an ethical one.
Put another way, if people can opt in to bungee jumping and skydiving, if eu-
thanasia is legal, then experimenting with self-governmental systems that vary
dramatically from the status quo should also be legal. Many of them won’t work,
but many projects don’t work either; that doesn’t mean we stop people from
trying.
One way of thinking about this is that the typical Ford customer doesn’t care
about how Ford’s internal aﬀairs are managed. The buyer doesn’t care whether5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 225
Ford is organized by product or by function, whether they’re run top-down by the
CEO or in a consultative way with the board, whether they pay market salaries
or incentivize more heavily with stock. Ford could be a holocracy or a co-op.
So long as everyone has consented to be governed by the Ford CEO by signing
an employee agreement, and can leave if that agreement is no longer congenial,
Ford’s internal arrangements are ethical.
This logic works so long as you can opt out of Ford’s ecosystem completely.
Haveyoudriven a Ford, lately? It’s trickier when it’s something like Google,
which is so powerful that it’s hard for the non-Chinese portion of the planet to
fully opt out of. Then you might want some kind of say in what goes on inside
the Googleplex. Still, most companies aren’t Google. Setting aside the edge
case of “inescapable global ubiquity” for now, the ethical case for allowing opt-in
experiments in corporate governance is pretty strong, for taking a broad view of
the “consent of the governed.”
Now extend that idea to non-corporate governance, with coin governance as a
proof point, and network states as an endpoint. Questions arise. How could
consent be given? How could others measure that consent was freely given?
And what if someone wants to retract that consent, perhaps right before they’re
subject to an act of governance they don’t like?
In practice, we say that a user has consented to be governed by a startup society
if he has signed a social smart contract that gives a system administrator limited
privilegesoverthatuser’sdigitallifeinreturnforadmissiontothestartupsociety.
This portmanteau term combines Rousseau’s concept of the “social contract” with
the blockchain concept of the “smart contract.”
Signing the social smart contract is very similar to depositing your funds with
a centralized exchange, or locking them up in a smart contract with admin keys
– you’re taking conscious risk with an on-chain asset in return for admission
to a digital ecosystem. Now imagine using your ENSto “log in” to a startup
society, thereby giving it limited privileges over your account in order to enter
that startup society.
What does that log in entail? The simplest version of this is using your ENS
to log into a startup society community. A more sophisticated version is using
your ENS to enter a part of the so-called “open metaverse” governed by a startup
society. But the most interesting version is using your ENS to log into oﬄine
territory owned by a startup society, as in the aforementioned example where an
ENS handshake opens a smart lock, or the one where it shows a glowing sigil.
You might also have to put down a deposit to physically enter a startup society
managed territory.226 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
You can extrapolate that ENS-login-to-physical-world example dramatically. As
more physical territories are crowdfunded by a startup society, and more smart
devices within those territories are owned by the society, it can exert consensual
digital governance within those territories on all who opted in by signing the
socialsmartcontract. Forexample, ifsomeonemisbehaveswithinagivenstartup-
society-owned jurisdiction, after a Kleros-style digital trial, their deposits could
be frozen and their ENS locked out of all doors for a time period as a punishment.
This is at ﬁrst blush similar to what’s already happening in both the West and
China, where Canadian trucker funds are being frozen and WeChat QR codes are
being used as instruments of digital control...but with one enormous diﬀerence,
which is that if",1993
153,"we can build many diﬀerent startup societies to choose from,
thenthere is much more practical consent of the governed, because there are
many startup societies to choose from with explicit social smart contracts.
Essentially, the key insight is that “government” is becoming synonymous with
digital government. In any US-establishment- controlled territory your Google
account will soon be frozen for crossing the US establishment. In any CCP-
controlled territory your WeChat account can be frozen for crossing the CCP. But
in any crypto-anarchic territory there may not be much in the way of functional
digital services at all. So if one wants modernity constrained by cryptography, the
concept of the “social smart contract” is one way to achieve consensual, limited
government – to limit what a government can do by tightly limiting its access to
your digital identity and resources, much like you can control exactly how much
you deposit onto a centralized exchange.
That sounds good at ﬁrst. Then it sounds bad. Because if governance is limited
solely to the digital realm, only to on-chain assets and smart locks, how does a
startup society deal with physical criminals? The short answer is that for a long
time, it doesn’t – it leaves that to the surrounding legacy society, much like a
centralized crypto exchange collaborates with traditional oﬄine law enforcement.
Eventually, if and when that startup society becomes a network state – in the
sense of achieving diplomatic recognition from a legacy sovereign – then it can
potentially take on physical law enforcement duties.
In the meantime, physical law enforcement itself is gradually turning into some-
thing done with autonomous robots - whether they be legged robodogs, rolling
cameras, or ﬂying drones. So more law enforcement is being done from a com-
mand line. And that trend gradually converges with the concept of digital law
enforcement by a network state.
To summarize: when we say that a network state has “consensual government
limited by a social smart contract”, we mean that it exercises authority over
a digital (and, eventually, physical) sphere constituted solely of those people
who’ve opted in to its governance by signing a social smart contract with their
ENS names, in much the same way they might “opt in” to the governance of a
centralized exchange by depositing coins there.5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 227
•A virtual capital. A network state is physically distributed, but its people still
digitally assemble in one place. That cloud assembly point could initially be
something as modest as a Discord channel, but will eventually be a private sub-
network of the open metaverse. That means a virtual reality (VR) environment
with parts that can be seamlessly projected into the physical world with aug-
mented reality (AR) glasses, so that you can see digital people, buildings, or
objects in the real world, like this. Access to a network state’s virtual capital,
like everything else in a network state, is gated by web3 login limited to citizens.
The most ambitious version of this allows community members to gather online
to create virtual architectural blueprints for new physical nodes of the network
state, as per this tweet. The reason this is feasible is that architecture is moving
to VR. You could imagine a much higher resolution version of Minecraft that
gets materialized into the physical world by a crowdfunded contractor (or by
community members with construction experience themselves). Think about the
scene from Fight Club where the camera swivels around the room to show price
tags on everything, and now imagine that in VR, with the cost to materialize
each virtual structure in the physical world hovering above it.
•An on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real estate
footprint. A distributed society needs a distributed census. Unlike the US census,
and more like Facebook’s census of its userbase, a startup society’s census can be
conducted in real-time rather than every ten years. But a skeptical world won’t
just take those numbers on faith, given a ﬂedgling startup society’s incentive
to overestimate them. They may trust the US government, or even Facebook
(a public company) on its audited user numbers, but not some upstart startup
society - not without some proof.
But how do you prove that a given startup society reallyhas 10,000 residents
and one billion dollars in annual income and 10M square meters in its real es-
tate footprint? Each of these elements can be established via on-chain data. We
already have techniques for proof-of-human, proof-of-income (via on-chain ac-
counting) and proof-of-real-estate (via blockchain real estate). We can get into
technical detail on how you solve the “crypto oracle problem” of getting oﬀ-chain
data reliably onto the blockchain, but the short version is that you can use a sta-
tistical estimator to take into account the fact that individual oracles may have
errors. By accumulating the censuses of all startup societies in a hypothetical
nationrealestatepop.com site similar to coinmarketcap.com , you could track
in realtime the number of startup society members, the acreage of real estate
owned by those members, and their on-chain GDP.
•Attain a measure of diplomatic recognition. Now we come to the main event:228 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
diplomatic recognition. Diplomatic recognition by a pre-existing government is
what distinguishes a network state from a startup society, just as “diplomatic
recognition” by an exchange like the NASDAQ distinguishes a public company
from a startup.
Diplomatic recognition requires a putative state to have clout, and clout is in
turn established by a publicly veriﬁable on-chain census of population, income,
and real estate, to provethat your growing society is as large as you say it is.
That’s why the aforementioned census is important.
Putting all that together, we can see that the deﬁnition of a network state culminates
in attaining diplomatic recognition from a pre-existing government, which requires far
more substance, leadership, physical presence, and long-term commitment than a typ-
ical online community, or even a cryptocurrency. It may be a LARP, but it’s not done
on a lark.
Breaking the Deﬁnition
You can start to see why we have several parts to the deﬁnition. If you subtract one
part you get something that doesn’t quite match our intuition of what the next version
of the nation state should be. Let’s do that, subtracting each part just to see how it
breaks.
•No social network. If there’s no social network, you have no digital proﬁles,
no messaging, no community fora, no mass media, and no easy way to recruit
from the internet. You’d essentially be living an Amish life, relying on pieces of
paper or oﬄine cues to determine who was part of your new state and how they
interacted. This isn’t going to succeed the nation state.
•No recognized founder. With no recognized leader, you have no way of making
contentious decisions or setting the agenda.A founder is the best kind of leader,
because they have the legitimacy associated with building an organization from
scratch. Unlike a dictator, their authority isn’t forcedupon the population, and
anyone can exit at any time. And unlike a media oligarchy, a founder’s authority
doesn’t arise from propagandistic bombardment but from free choice.
•No sense of national consciousness. If there is no sense of national consciousness,
there is no nation underpinning the network state. It’s just a bunch of random
people with nothing in common.
•No capacity for collective action. A group of people that lacks a capacity for
collective action - like most online communities, frankly - isn’t going to get any-
where.Even if they have national consciousness, without the capacity to orga-5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 229
nize (which arises in part from a leader), they certainly can’t build a state.
•No in-person level of civility. A group of people that constantly tears each other
down won’t build an outhouse together, let alone a state. More deeply, the folks
who throw around slogans like “civility is tone policing” or “kill your heroes” are
actually engaged in endless status competition , because they have rejected the
current hierarchy but not yet accepted a new one. In a functioning, legitimate
hierarchy (see diagram here) there’s a mechanism for dispute resolution that
doesn’t involve summoning a mob for every slight.
•No integrated cryptocurrency. After the ﬁnancial deplatforming of Western proles
and foreign elites, of Canadian truckers and 145M Russians, it’s clear that digital",1998
154,"ﬁnance is a weapon of war. So without a sovereign digital currency (and, more
generally, a sovereign system of record) there is no sovereignty.
•No archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories. You can do many things
online, but not everything. Without physical territory you can’t build FDA-
free zones, or NRC-free areas, or the Keto Kosher community, or many kinds
of substantive parallel societies. You also can’t meet, mate, mingle, and do all
the other things humans do in person. And most importantly you’re not going
to be taken seriously as a successor to the nation state without a large physical
footprint. The approach of knitting together crowdfunded physical territory into
a network archipelago addresses these issues.
•No virtual capital. Network states are not city states. City states were defeated
by nation states for a reason: they are physically centralized and have limited
scale. So particularist city states populated by small ethnic groups get rolled up
by universalist nation states (or empires) with many ethnic groups.230 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
That’s the reason a network state has a virtual capital rather than a physical one.
Think of it as “remote-ﬁrst,” but for a society. In a remote company, nothing
oﬃcially exists unless it’s online, in an internal system of record like GitHub.
Similarly, in a remote society, nothing oﬃcially exists unless it’s on-chain, in the
blockchain system of record for that society.
Put another way: if you don’t consciously set the capital of your network state
to be virtual, it’ll be physical. And if it’s physical, the capital is centralized in
one place, and can get invaded by a nation state. But if it’s instead a virtual
capital, with a backend that is encrypted and on-chain, then - in the fullness of
time - you can host an entire subset of the metaverse there, assuming blockspace
increases as bandwidth did.
•No on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real estate
footprint. The US Census is in the US Constitution for a reason; you need to
know something about your people to run a government. But for a network state,
the challenges are diﬀerent than those that faced the Founding Fathers.
The hard part isn’t how to collectthe data; with modern technology it can be
slurped up and dashboarded in real-time, rather than collected every ten years
on millions of pieces of paper. No, the hard part is getting people to believethe
data, given the huge incentives for faking the numbers.
That means establishing a cryptographically auditable information supply chain,
a transparent way of gathering the numbers for the network state census. That
means showing the work so that people don’t needto trust you, and can run the
computation themselves.
Why is this important? Think again about the emergence of Bitcoin. Price was a
signal, asignalofstrength. Millionsoftradesacrossdozensofexchangesproduced
a signal that was reliable enough for companies and eventually governments to
act upon. Price is why Bloomberg listed Bitcoin on a ticker in 2013. And price
is why El Salvador recognized Bitcoin as a sovereign currency in 2021. We’re not
talking about the short-term price here, which is and will be highly volatile, but
the long-term price - the secular trend.
Similarly, if people can check for themselves that there’s a startup society that
has built itself into an network archipelago with 10M square meters of land, over5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 231
10 billion dollars in annual income, and 100k people, then that starts to become
a society worthy of diplomatic recognition.
•No measure of diplomatic recognition. Many libertarians don’t get the concept
of diplomatic recognition, just like many progressives don’t get the desirability of
starting new countries, so this point is worth discussing.
What happens if you don’t have diplomatic recognition? Then you aren’t in the
club of legitimate states. That means any government can invade you at will,
and the others will just shrug. It also means you don’t have access to things like
sovereign debt markets. You can’t ink trade or passport deals. You likely can’t
buy many goods and services that corporations or states sell only to other states,
because you’re not considered a legitimate government by the rest of the market.
You certainly can’t write new regulations for your jurisdiction, because others do
not recognize your lawful authority over that jurisdiction, and can (again) invade
you at will.
Basically, without diplomatic recognition, you aren’t considered real. That’s why
micronations don’t work. They have no organic community, so they have no
answer to the question of “you and what army?” And even more importantly, no
answer to the question of “you and what legitimacy?”
You can think of diplomatic recognition by a pre-existing state as a “non-binding
commitment to not invade.” Subsequent to recognition, the startup society now
gains the ability to write laws governing the physical world in their patch of
territory without being invaded - at least by the recognizing state.This is why
werequirediplomatic recognition in the deﬁnition of a network state.
This gives you a sense of why each of the parts of the deﬁnition exist. A network state
is at least as complex as a nation state, but the diﬀerence is that the latter already
exists, so we take for granted how it works.
What’s next? Once the ﬁrst diplomatic recognition comes, and the ﬁrst true network
state arises, more will follow. That means we need to start thinking about the network
state system.232 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES",1349
155,"5.3.2 What is the Network State System?
The next step is to outline the assumptions of the network state system as a whole.
Read this and compare it to those of the nation state system.
•Digital ﬁrst. The digital network of the internet is primary.
•Composition . A network state is composed of a national network (the equivalent
of the nation) and a governance network (the analog of the state). Unlike a
typical social network, a national network self-identiﬁes as a nation. Unlike a
typical social network company, a governance network is set up by that national
network as the legitimate government of that digital people.
•Terra incognita returns. The network state system assumes many pieces of the
internet will become invisible to other subnetworks. In particular, small network
states may adopt invisibility as a strategy; you can’t hit what you can’t see.
•Terra nullius returns. The network state system further assumes that unclaimed
digitalterritoryalwaysexistsintheformofnewdomainnames,cryptousernames,
plotsoflandinthemetaverse, socialmediahandles, andaccountsonnewservices.
•Bottom-up migration of people. The network state system embraces the fuzzy
divisionoftheinternetintodiﬀerentsovereignsubnetworks. Itisaprobabilistic
digital division of peoplerather than a deterministic physical division
ofland.People migrate digitally and physically between network states; the
citizenry is as dynamic as the land of a nation state is static.
•N networks per citizen. Unlike the nation state system, where most people have
citizenship in only one state, in the network state system, every person can in
principle be a member of more than one state, just as they can hold passports
in more than one country, or be holders of more than one cryptocurrency, or be
users of more than one social network. Of course, they can spend most of their
time in one network state.
•Legitimacy from physical migration and digital choice. The power of network
states is constrained by consent and cryptography. First, recall that the gover-
nance network of a given network state is the analog to the state of a traditional
country. This governance network only has control over those digital citizens (ne-
tizens) that have opted in, individually or collectively, to its governance, much as
one explicitly signs an employment contract when joining a company or implicitly
signs a social contract when stepping across a border. A given national network
can choose a governance network as an administrator, thereby forming (or join-
ing) a network state with an on-chain record of their collective decision. Or an
individual can join a network state on their own. Cryptography ensures that
this choice is demonstrably free and uncoerced, because no state can easily seize
an individual’s private keys. Cryptography further guarantees basic rights like
freedom of speech, free migration, private property, freedom of digital assembly
and the like, so long as each user has exclusive access to their private keys.5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 233
•Decentralized administration. The group of people that administers a network
state, which we call a governance network, is composed of a founder/chief execu-
tive and their engineers. They write laws in code to specify what is mandatory,
encouraged, discouraged, and forbidden. These laws are interpreted by impar-
tial servers and enforced by cryptography. In the network state system, each
social subnetwork can choose which governance network administers them, as
determined both by their physical location and where their digital property lies.
Over time, this means polycentric law: people in a given physical area can switch
between network states (and thus governance providers) just as they switch be-
tween Uber and Lyft as taxi regulators, or Bitcoin and Ethereum as monetary
regulators.
•Domestic monopoly of root access. Thegovernancenetworkofanetworkstatehas
root access to an administrative interface where law enforcement can ﬂip digital
switches as necessary to maintain or restore domestic order, just like the sysad-
mins of today’s tech companies. Of course, postulating the existence of such an
interface presupposes a world where everything from money to messaging, doors
to dwellings, farms to factories, ﬂying drones to walking droids can be controlled
from a single computer — but that world isn’t far oﬀ, and today there are few
checks on the digital power of the tech companies that are bringing it into being.
The network state system checks this power in two ways: by maintaining pri-
vate keys (so foreign states and corporations cannot interfere in domestic aﬀairs)
and by enabling exit (so citizens can execute ﬁnancial and electoral votes of no
conﬁdence if need be, both as individuals and as groups).
•International sovereignty via cryptography. For a network state, sovereignty is
private keys. If access to the aforementioned administrative interface is con-
trolled by private keys rather than a username/password combination, then the
same encryption techniques that make it diﬃcult for an outsider to seize an indi-
vidual’s private keys can make it diﬃcult for a foreign rival to steal a legitimate
government’s private keys. This is a completely new way of defending sovereignty,
a complement and/or replacement for the military.
•Digital diplomatic recognition. Networkstatescanrecognizeeachotherbilaterally
(similar to an API integration) or multilaterally ( e.g., by supporting the same
blockchains). When people exit to other network states, whether digitally or
physically, they bring their most valuable possessions with them in the form of
private keys. Some of these keys give access to property in global blockchains,
others give access to physical goods like cars and houses, and still others give
access to records hosted on state-run chains, like their netizen proﬁle in the
network state they just left. Diplomatic recognition is then about interoperability
and compatibility: are the ﬁle formats and on-chain records used by one network
state honored by another?
•Chains manage cooperation and constraint. Public blockchains are the equivalent
of international law in a network state system. They facilitate economic and234 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
social cooperation between network states and their netizens, but also constrain
those states with cryptographically binding code.
•Pax Bitcoinica. The ultimate guarantor of exit, and of the network state system
at large, is Bitcoin. As cryptocurrency rises in strength, Bitcoin or something like
it becomes a government of governments. It sits above every state and constrains
it from printing inﬁnite quantities of money, from lawlessly seizing the funds of its
citizens, and from waging forever war. In doing so, it limits that which will never
limit itself. And even if the Bitcoin protocol speciﬁcally fails, or its cryptography
has a bug, the concept of cryptocurrency and the choice it represents will not
disappear from this earth.
Assumption: Digital Primary, Physical Secondary
One point we touched on above, but that bears repeating, is that the network state
system assumes the world has ﬂipped to digital ﬁrst : all nontrivial human-created
events start in the cloud and then, if important, are “printed out” into the physical
world.
Think about anything a human does today: all oﬃce work is online, as is much social-
ization. Courts are now online, as are politicians. So is money. So is agriculture, and
manufacturing, and shipping. The phone has indeed become the remote control for
the world. Many previously oﬄine devices — cars, doors, desks, weights, coﬀeemakers,
even toothbrushes — are coming online. Even pacemakers leave a digital trace.
The physical still exists, of course. There are still physical human beings, there are
still physical plots of land, there are still physical rivers and mountains. And for some
law enforcement and military functions a network state will need physical robots.
But in a network state, everything physical is downstream of lines of code and enforced
by cryptography, just as in a nation state, everything physical is downstream of pieces
of paper and enforced by the police and military.
Assumption: The State Becomes An Admin Dashboard
A second assumption is that once every interface is digital, it can be put online. And
once online, in the absence of private keys, it can be centrally controlled.
So, the network state system assumes that states like the USA and PRC will continue
centralizing the power of their tech companies into one all-seeing dashboard, capable
of surveilling, deplatforming, freezing, and sanctioning millions at once, or anyone at
will. This digital power is currently exercised transnationally and without the consent
of the governed. They have no true free choice of administrator.",1986
156,"The network state system assumes that we can’t fully put this genie back in the bottle,
but we can constrain it. Speciﬁcally, we grant that every legitimate state will need
such power to govern its subnetwork, for the same reason any centralized service needs
a system administrator with root access. But we also build decentralized services that5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 235
do not have any single system administrator, and tools for the physical and digital exit
of citizens.
Assumption: Divide Networks Rather than Land
Justasinthepre-Westphalianperiod, wheretheCatholicChurchexertedtransnational
control, the digital power wielded by the American and Chinese empires invalidates
traditional notions of sovereignty. The Peace of Westphalia equivalent is a network
state system that limits the digital power of states solelyto those who have opted in.
Just as post-Westphalian nation states were limited in control to people within their
territory, post-Satoshian network states will be limited in control to people who’ve
opted into their network. It is a division of the world by network rather than by land.
Assumption: Consent and Cryptography Constrain
So, inshort, intheworldofthenetworkstate, bothstatesandcitizensalikearepowered
up. Network states have a root dashboard with full access to every digital aspect of the
network they govern. They also have security from outside interference because access
to these dashboards is gated via private keys rather than passwords.
However, this immense digital power is typically deployed nonviolently (unlike with
existing states) and constrained by cryptographic and physical exit, rather than by
paper laws or toothless treaties. This is what powers up citizens, who freely choose
whether to enter or exit, either collectively or individually.
Thus, the legitimacy of a network state comes not from top-down declamations, but
from bottom-up consent, as each netizen has opted in. A truly oppressive or incompe-
tent network state loses them to exit, or doesn’t gain citizens in the ﬁrst place. And
no state is strong enough to block the ultimate exit that cryptocurrency represents.",476
157,"5.3.3 The Network State as a Term
We can unpack the term “network state” in several useful and complementary ways.
1.The network is the nation. The organic, voluntary, bottom-up nation that un-
derpins the state is formed online in a network. This could be on the basis of
language, culture, proposition, or some combination thereof. This represents a
digital remedy to the phenomenon Putnam identiﬁed in Bowling Alone . In the
year 2000, we were bowling alone but by 2020 we were posting together. COVID-
19 accelerated this process — people were spread apart in the physical world but
packed together online.
2.The network is the territory. VR isn’t yet fully mature, but when it is, we’ll
identify the territory of a network state as a subnetwork of the open metaverse.
We can understand this if we think about domain names, social proﬁles, and ENS
names — digital land can be created for free, but access to that land can become
very valuable (and, when deplatforming is in the cards, very contentious). The236 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
analogy to land goes very deep — to fully understand it, you need to understand
graph layouts, but in short you can make maps of networks given any graph
adjacency matrix. And if you use the distance metric of “number of degrees of
separation in a social network,” that looks quite diﬀerent from the map you get
from a geographical distance matrix.
3.The network is the state. How does a network state create and enforce laws?
Digitally. It’sLocke’sjustiﬁcationofthestateastheprotectorofprivateproperty,
in the form of a digital registry. And it’s Lessig’s code-is-law, but on-chain. Our
entire antiquated process of adversarially writing high-stakes laws on paper at
the last minute, deploying them in production to hundreds of millions of people
without any testing, and then getting them interpreted in unpredictable ways by
regulators and solicitors will be seen as a bizarre relic of an older time. Paper
laws will go the way of powdered wigs.
4.The Network is the Leviathan. Here, we capitalize Network as it’s being used
in the sense of God, State, Network. The Network here is a candidate for the
most powerful force in the world, where the Leviathan in the Hobbesian sense
is not divinity (God) or military (the State) but community and cryptography
(Network). From this viewpoint, the Network State can be seen as a fusion of
Leviathans, like the God/State combination of the mid-century USA, where the
Marines fought for “God and Country” and where Americans pledged allegiance
to the ﬂag “under God.”
So: in a network state, the network is the lives (national network), the land (metaverse
subnet), the law (governance network), and the Leviathan (Bitcoin network) all packed
into one. It’s the people, the digital territory they occupy, the rules that bind them,
and the power that enforces those laws.",724
158,"5.3.4 Micronetworks and Multinetworks
We noted earlier that a micronation is really a microstate, and many “nation states”
are actually multinational empires. These concepts generalize to networks.
We can think of a micronetwork as a startup that intends to build a social network,
but has zero users. So a micronetwork is like a micronation that plants a ﬂag, but
has zero citizens. Similarly, a multinetwork like Facebook is a billion-person-scale
socialnetworkwithmanysubnetworksunderonecompany...justlikethemultinational
Roman Empire, where many diﬀerent groups were ruled by one state. Perhaps there’s
a reason Zuck admires Augustus.
But the analogy breaks down in an important way.
Startups create Networks, but Nations create States
In a “micronetwork,” aka a startup, the startup createsthe network that it ends up
managing, both in the sense of the people in that network and the digital domain itself.5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 237
Zuck came ﬁrst, then registered thefacebook.com ; only then came the users. But in a
real nation, the people and their physical domain precedethe state. For example, the
Japanese people and islands predate the current Japanese government.
That’s one way people went wrong with micronations. You can’t just treat them like
a normal startup where you start with one person and build an impersonal product!
The prospective network state founder needs to think about “nation building” from day
one. That’s not just community building on steroids — ideally, that nation building
process is really nation discovery . In other words, there’s an existing community out
there with an unexpressed national identity at the top of their identity stack, and they
want to crowdfund territory and build their decentralized Zion. The network state is
then just a catalyst for this.
Startups create Networks, but Startups aren’t States
Of course, people have also gone wrong with the startup-to-state analogy in a diﬀerent
way: by thinking startups could act just like states without a legitimating process.
Suppose we try the analogy that “state is to a startup as nation is to network.” That
is, just as a state manages a nation and sets its laws, a startup like early Facebook or
Twitter manages a social network and sets its policy.
This worked, until it didn’t. Facebook and Twitter have succeeded beyond anyone’s
expectations, yet they weren’t set up to be governments. People didn’t consciously
sign a social contract to be governed by them. Facebook and Twitter grew to take over
much of people’s lives, but have no concept of digital property rights. Seizures and
silencing weren’t part of the bargain.
StartupscreateCentralizedNetworks, butChainscreateDecentralizedNet-
works
There are at least two ways to add genuine choice, and hence legitimacy, to centralized
networks.
1.Free the backend. On a free spot of land, you can have a nation without a
governing state. Similarly, if we had a free region of the cloud, we could have
a network without a governing startup. That’s what Satoshi did: he reopened
the frontier, gave us a cloud without corporations. He showed us how to create
digital networks without any single centralized authority. One extension of that
gives us decentralized social networks, the basis for an open metaverse. So that’s
one way to solve the problem: build digital land that isn’t controlled by any
single startup. Anyone on that land could then freely choose between governance
networks.
2.Free the login. The other, related way out is to retroﬁt an existing centralized
socialnetworktoenableweb3login, suchthatuserscancontacteachother outside
the service and their usernames are not locked into the system. Note that this238 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
is far more substantive than merely allowing users to “export their data” — it’s
more like the capability to message your followers without Facebook or Twitter’s
permission.
Only Decentralized Networks can give rise to Network States
Without one or ideally both of these features (decentralized backend and decentralized
login), a micronetwork might grow into a multinetwork, just like 0-person Facebook
became 3 billion-person Facebook...but it wouldn’t have the legitimation of exit that
enables a true network state. The millions of people on current platforms (and future
ones) must be given the option to leavewithall their digital valuables in order for
their stay to be considered uncoerced.",1072
159,"5.3.5 0-network, 1-network, N-networks
We know that multinational empires tend to have the same failure modes as microna-
tions: the state doesn’t actually represent a single distinct people, and thus fails on
that basis.
Towards that end, it’s worth taking the overloaded term of “social networks” and disag-
gregating it into 0-networks, 1, networks, and N-networks, just as we did for microna-
tions, nation states, and multinational empires.
Here’s a concrete example:
•0-network : Facebook at inception, 1 person founder, no users
•1-network : Facebook at Harvard, one month after founding
•N-network : Facebook today, 3+ billion users
And here’s the underlying deﬁnitions that inform that example:
•0-network : an aspirational social network startup with no users
•1-network : a coherent community
•N-network : a massive global network of networks
In more detail:
A0-network is a startup with aspirations for creating a large social network, messaging
app, two-sided marketplace, crypto exchange, or other digital watering hole where5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 239
people interact. Note that not every online service ﬁts this deﬁnition; some apps like
Mathematica or Photoshop are pure utilities.
AnN-network is the equivalent of a multinational empire. It’s nota good base for a
network state, for the simple reason that it doesn’t represent a single nation, a set of
coherent people. For example, the 300M users of Twitter or the 3B+ users of Facebook
are uniﬁed by nothing more than a desire for likes. Of course, some of the subnetworks
of an N-network may have enough asabiyyah to form a network state.
A1-network is the basis for a network state, something like a focused subreddit, a
moderated Facebook group, a PHP BB forum, a large Telegram channel, or the follow-
ing of a single Twitter inﬂuencer. Of course, not all subreddits would be 1-networks,
butr/ketowith its intense dietary culture is much closer than a global forum like
r/worldnews . A 1-network typically has some basic form of moderation (a moderator
can ban you, an inﬂuencer can block you), some community norms, and mechanisms
for enforcement. It doesn’t have allthe criteria of a nation — the shared language,
customs, history, and culture — but it’s like a proto-nation.
The following of a single large YouTube or Twitter inﬂuencer is probably the best kind
of 1-network out there, in the sense of a proto-nation for a network state, because it
has shared context and history, as well as pointers towards a leader who can act as a
dispute resolver.",665
160,"5.3.6 What is a (National) Network?
We now have a few deﬁnitions in hand:
•the properties of a nation
•the idea of a network state as a combination of a national network (the people)
and a governance network (the state)
•and the just-introduced concept of a 1-network as a proto-nation, an embryonic
version of the national network that underpins a network state
We also earlier noted that the deﬁnition of a nation was a bit fuzzy, both in the
dictionary sense and according to diﬀerent thinkers. With those preliminaries, we can
now give a computational answer to the question of “what is a nation?”
A Verbal Description
You can redeﬁnea traditional nation as a densely connected subgraph in a social net-
work. Basedonsomemetric—suchaslinguisticdistance, genomicdistance, ideological
distance, or cryptocurrency holdings — the nodes of a bona ﬁde nation should group
more tightly with each other than they do with other networks.240 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
In mathematical terms, nations are highly connected subgraphs of a global network
according to one or more network distance metrics, like
•geographic distance : great circle distance on surface of earth
•network distance : degrees of separation in a social network
•genetic distance : eg,F(ﬁxation index) or another measure
•linguistic distance : eg, lexicostatistical measures
•economic distance : eg, 1 — cosine similarity
•ideological distance : degree of similarity in belief as expressed by spatial theory
of voting
The advantage of this deﬁnition is that while it’s still fuzzy (how connected exactly
does the subgraph have to be?), it’s now amenable to quantitative analysis. Given a
network, a set of distance metrics, and some parameter choices, the subgraphs pop out.
By this deﬁnition, a real nation would have more ingroup than outgroup connections,
more “domestic” than “international” calls.
A Computational Approach
Here’s how you’d actually do that computation.
•Begin with any large N-network like Twitter with K= 300Musers andNpostu-
lated subnetworks. Calculate any or all of the following distance metrics between
individuals, if you have available data, using the deﬁnitions from the preceding
section.
–d(geographic distance)
–d(network distance)
–d(genetic distance)
–d(linguistic distance)
–d(economic distance)
–d(ideological distance)
•Suppose we have six such metrics. Calculate them on Kpeople, to form a K
K6tensor of distances.
•Also collect a training set of labeled edges, where two people are marked as being
part of the same 1-network or not, designated by Y= 1. For example, you might
put two English-speaking Bitcoin holders who own guns, subscribe to r/keto,
and follow each other on Twitter in the same 1-network.
•Now use any machine learning technique to estimate P(Y= 1jd). Something
like Naive Bayes can work, or something more sophisticated.5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 241
•Finally, set a threshold of say P(Y= 1jd)>0:50. All the densely connected
subgraphs that pop out of that process are the 1-networks.
Inotherwords, givenasetofpostulatedmeasuresofnationalsimilarity, abitoftraining
data, and a parameter choice, we can clustera large network into subgraphs. Applied
to continental scale social networks like Facebook and Twitter, we’d be able to see
diﬀerent kinds of clusters pop out for diﬀerent parameter choices, much like you do
with the lasso.
Assuming you could get access to a global dataset like Facebook or Twitter’s network
(or scrape it), you could turn all philosophical disputes about what a nation is into
simply a set of parameter choices. That means a nation is a subnetwork in a global
social graph.",944
161,"5.3.7 What does a Network State look like on a Map?
The ﬁrst thing is to specify which map we mean: a map of the physical world, or of
the digital world?
The Physical Map
In physical space, a network state looks like an archipelago of interconnected enclaves.
As the dashboard above shows, netizens crowdfund territory around the world, link
those pieces together digitally, and then use technologies like web3 logins and mixed
reality to seamlessly link the online and oﬄine.
Each such node of the network state represents a group of digital citizens who have
chosen to live together in the physical world. As shown in the dashboard, the network
state’s population, income, and real estate is summed over all netizens across all net-
work nodes. As the state grows, these numbers can, over time, become comparable to
the footprint of legacy nation states, including the real estate footprint.
So, a network state is a physically distributed state, a bit like Indonesia, but with its
pieces of land separated by internet rather than ocean.
The Digital Map
In digital space, a network state looks like a densely connected subgraph of a large
social network. In our terminology, it’s a 1-network, not an N-network. To gain some
intuition for digital space, realize that it is very diﬀerent from physical space:
•Dimensionality . Youdon’thavejustthetwodimensionsoflatitudeandlongitude,
in a complex social network, you might need N dimensions to properly represent
the graph structure.
•Plasticity . Imagine one day, South Africa suddenly appeared near NYC, with
a footbridge to connect the two. That’s like Spotify doing a deal with Uber;
suddenly, two huge networks get bridged and people can start walking across.242 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
This will become much more obvious as metaverse subnetworks are connected
and disconnected by management on the basis of diplomatic relations between
network states.
•Speed. Take a look at the full global footprint of the British Empire at its zenith,
and now realize that Facebook achieved greater global penetration than that in
just a few years.
•Elasticity . It’s hard to create more land (Dubai has done some work in the area,
and cruise ships arguably count), but it’s easy to create more digital land —
albeit hard to make it valuable. The value of land is based on location, location,
location, but for digital real estate it’s connection, connection, connection.
•Invisibility . We take for granted that we can see the Franco/German border, that
we know who is on either side. But no one can really see the Facebook/Twitter
border, the set of users that have accounts on both services but use them both for
roughly 50% of their time online. Borders between nation states are by default
highly visible, borders between networks are by default invisible.
This last point is truly deep: we’re going back to terra incognita , toterra nullius , to
the time of secret societies, to the time of “Here Be Dragons.” The open web is already
dark to all but Google, the social web is already dark to all but Facebook and Twitter
et al., and while the third web will have some parts that are globally transparent, much
of it will be intentionally private and encrypted.
This is not a bad thing; in many ways, what we did over the last few decades was
upload the entire world in unencrypted form online. Never before has it been possible
for so many to stalk anyone. The re-encryption of the world has started with a tactical
retreat from public social networks towards Signal groups, but it will go much further.
We may have hit peak map. Cartography becomes harder in a digital space that’s
darker and more dynamic than the well-lit physical world. Continents, once discovered,
don’t tend to move on you, but the internet brings us back to the time of Pangaea —
millions of nodes can disconnect and reconnect elsewhere all at once should they see
ﬁt, and new supercontinents of 100M+ connected users like TikTok can just arise out
of nowhere.
In short, our intuitions for digital space are just completely diﬀerent from physical
space. We’llreturntothistopic, butrecognizethatitreallyisafundamentaldiﬀerence:
while the nation state is based on a deterministic physical division of landinto states,
the network state is based on probabilistic digital division of peopleinto subnetworks.
Example: Physically Proximal, Digitally Divergent
Take a look at this tweet. It shows that in physical space, the red and blue areas of the
United States are cheek-by-jowl, but in digital space they are wholly disjoint. Thus,
the US is not really a “nation” state. It’s at least a binational state, what we’d call a5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 243
2-network, with two strongly connected subgraphs at each other’s throats. These two
nations are packed into the same physical environment, but are far apart mentally.
A network state makes the opposite tradeoﬀ. It’s a group of people spread out in
physical space, but highly aligned in digital space. It’s a 1-network, not an N-network.",1225
162,"5.3.8 How is a Network State Founded?
We just talked about the need for a 1-network to be the basis of a network state,
unlike an N-network. A 1-network is a focused, moderated community like Ethereum
Research, while an N-network is something like Facebook in the early 2020s, with N
communities under its multibillion-person banner (where N is very large).
But there’s another constraint for network state creation beside the 1-network, and
that’s the constraint of reality. Saying “I’m founding a network state” is a little like
saying “I’m founding a billion-dollar public company.” It’s not an impossible goal,
but it’s diﬃcult, and we want to avoid terminological dilution and encourage realistic
ambition.
If we think about the startup community, we have a few deﬁnitions that allow us to
talk about stages. We have startup companies and tech companies. We have seed, VC,
and growth investors. We have bootstrapped companies and we have venture-backed
companies. We have early stage vehicles, billion-dollar unicorns, and trillion-dollar tech
giants.
Along the same lines, let’s introduce a few deﬁnitions that help us establish the path
to the network state.
As umbrella terms, we’ll use the concepts of startup societies and parallel societies,
whichareroughlyanalogoustostartupsandtechcompaniesrespectively. Likeastartup
(and unlike a small business), a startup society is a small group with ambitions of doing
big things. Like a tech company (and unlike a legacy entity), a parallel society is a
small-to-large group of people with at least one proposed major innovation relative to
how things were done before.
As sequential terms, we’ll talk about network unions, network archipelagos, and net-
work states. These are roughly analogous to seed, Series B, and public companies
respectively in terms of how much eﬀort it takes to build them. A network union is
fully digital but is a real organization with money and a purpose, like a seed startup
that no longer merely exists on paper but has daily todos and folks doing things. A
network archipelago has built up enough money to crowdfund physical territory, like
a Series B company that has earned enough money to be taken more seriously. And a
network state has achieved diplomatic recognition from at least one legacy state, like a
public company that has jumped through all the necessary hoops to be recognized by
the NASDAQ.244 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
Those are rough deﬁnitions. Let’s get a bit more precise.
Startup Societies
You’re founding a startup society, not a network state.
A startup society is a new community built internet-ﬁrst, usually for the purpose of
solving a speciﬁc social problem in an opt-in way. The implication is that this society
is still pretty small in population.
A parallel society is roughly equivalent to a startup society, but can be much larger in
scale. This is an umbrella term for a network union, network archipelago, or network
state.
And now we have a way to talk about origins in a realistic way. You’re founding a
startup society. You begin as a network union, maybe crowdfund territory to become
a network archipelago, and could someday grow into a network state. All of these are
types of parallel societies.
This communicates the point that there are diﬀerent paths to a network state, and
diﬀerent (and completely valid) intermediate end points — just like you can run a
small business, a lifestyle business, do a merger/acquisition, or found a “mere” unicorn
rather than going public and achieving a trillion dollar valuation in the public markets.
I’d roughly calibrate the diﬃculty of founding a 1M person network state that achieves
diplomatic recognition from at least one city, state, or country at about the level of
founding a 10M person social network or a billion dollar company. Why? Because
small countries like Tuvalu, El Salvador, and the like havealready signed business
development deals with startups, so it’s no longer unheard of — just diﬃcult.
However, even if your ultimate goal is a unicorn, you don’t start out by saying “I’m
founding a unicorn.” You say you’re founding a startup.
By analogy, what do you say, rather than “I’m founding a network state”? The closest
thing out there was once “I’m starting a decentralized autonomous organization” (a
DAO). That’s better than “I’m starting a social network,” because a DAO at least
has an implicit concept of national identity, in the form of common coin-holding. A
social network does nothave this, because most social networks, by dint of being social
utilities, ﬂy past 1-networks and become N-networks if they are successful. However,
DAOs also are bedeviled by the downsides of markets and politics respectively: ﬂy-by-
night speculators and bureaucratic boondoggles abound.
So, if you want to eventually build a network state, you should instead start by saying
“I’m founding a startup society.”
Parallel Societies
We also use the term parallel society . This is roughly equivalent to a startup society,
but can be much larger in scale. It’s an umbrella term for a network union, network5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 245
archipelago, or network state. It emphasizes that you have a possibly huge society
running in parallel to legacy society, with at least one big piece that is wildly diﬀerent
from the existing world.
We discussed parallel societies in Chapter 2 .
The Network Union
A network union is a social graph organized in a tree-like structure with a leader, a
purpose, a crypto-based ﬁnancial and messaging system, and a daily call-to-action. It’s
the underpinning of the new nation behind a network state. It forms dense peer-to-peer
connections, not simply leader-to-follower. And it acclimatizes its members to working
together as a society towards a common purpose.
Thatpurposemakes it diﬀerent from a social network like Twitter, a subreddit, or even
a DAO. The purpose isn’t to waste time, or aimlessly speculate on a token. It’s to
advance the collective interests of its members through daily actions, organized by a
network union leader.
That common purpose creates a culture, and gradually turns a group of people into
a 1-network, a network with national consciousness, into the foundation of a network
state. Think about it: if people won’t even show up to vote online, they don’t care
about the community. Conversely, if they’ve managed to do great things together as
part of a network union, they’ll be able to do more.
And that is in fact Renan’s deﬁnition of a nation:
To have done great things together, to want to do more, such are the es-
sential conditions to form a people...Man is not a slave to his race, or his
tongue, or his religion.
See also this earlier piece on network unions, before we tightened up some of the
deﬁnitions.
Public Displays of Alignment
Anetworkuniondoesn’tjustdoprivateactionsforthecollectivebeneﬁtofitsmembers.
It also does public actions which show the world at large how organized, aligned, self-
sacriﬁcing, and mutually cooperating the members of the network union are. Call these
public displays of alignment , a decorous riﬀ on the American concept of PDA.
As motivation, think about the many movies that center the tango in a campy-yet-
serious way. Dramatic music plays as man and woman lock eyes across the room
before beginning a series of complicated pirouettes. The dance ﬂoor clears a circle as
everyone pauses to watch. The whole room is now paying rapt attention to this couple,
even if they didn’t know them before.
That’s an example of positive-sum attention: because these two paid attention to each
otherin a public and synchronized way, others paid respectful attention to them. That246 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
couple must love each other very much — or at least must practice very much — and
their coordination demands admiration. Even the onlooker who doesn’t much care for
dancing must give a grudging nod.",1998
163,"Other examples of positive-sum attention like this include orchestras, parades, the good
kind of ﬂash mobs, basketball games, and the types of gymnastic enterprises common
to college football halftime shows wherein cheerleaders form tall human pyramids that
require complete trust in the people at the base.
All of these are examples of public multi-party coordination where people are creating
art together in a high-trust society. The coordination is pleasing to the eye. But it also
indicates to the audience that the people involved have practiced before, that they’re
aligned, that they aren’t all playing whatever notes they want at whatever time, that
there is some pre-arranged give and take. Public displays of positive-sum attention
show that two or more people can work together as a team.
The opposite also exists: negative-sum attention. When two people who are supposed
to be aligned ﬁght in public, when a corporation like the Washington Post melts down
on Twitter, or when a whole country broadcasts its endless internal conﬂict to the globe
each day, bystanders have a diﬀerent reaction. It’s not one of admiration and respect
for the tight coordination. It’s the opposite. The conﬂict causes a diminution of status
for all parties involved. The phrase “team of rivals” draws our attention because rivals
can’t really make up a team. A organization characterized by public inﬁghting isn’t an
organization, it’s an occasion for popcorn or pity.
Two notes before we move to the main point.
First, the kind of public conﬂict seen in a hard-fought NBA game or an Oxford-style
debate is diﬀerent, because a viewer could come away with respect for bothwinner and
loser. Why? That kind of conﬂict is between clearly delineated parties, within certain
rules that both entertain and constrain. It’s ritualized conﬂict, it’s expected. The loser
often gets paid for showing up. So it’s not a lose/lose ﬁght, not a cartoonish bar brawl.
Second, it’s impossible to run any organization of suﬃcient scale without somedegree
of internal misalignment. You don’t get to 500 million friends without making a few
enemies. There’s always someone with hard feelings — the envious, the disgruntled,
the ﬁred. They might start a ﬁght to gain what they could not by other means. The
consequent loss of status that accompanies a public ﬁght is like the loss of money that
accompanies a bad earnings report. It’s not desirable, but it’s absolutely survivable.
To make up for the loss of money, you work harder next time. But to make up for
the loss of status, you take a beat and ﬁgure out how to reunify your organization and
show a united front to the world. In a phrase, you need some PDA: a public display of
alignment.
Politicians do public displays of alignment all the time. They trash each other during
the primaries and then raise each others’ hands in the general election. They’re putting
their diﬀerences behind them to build a united front. Countries do this too — that’s5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 247
what peace treaties, mutual defense pacts, joint military exercises, and international
organizations are all about. The visual of ﬂags ﬂying together shows others that they’re
one unit.
And that brings us to the concept of public displays of alignment for a network union.
It’s important to startby organizing the network union to do private tasks that the
group as a whole beneﬁts from. But eventually you want to show the external world
that your network union can do impressive public things as a group.
So, what’s the digital version of a parade, or of a group singing in unison like the
Estonian Singing Revolution? It might be something like a crypto-Wikipedia, or some
kind of collectively authored art in virtual reality, perhaps like Minecraft or Reddit’s
r/place. It may need to involve proof-of-human so onlookers know that this piece of
digital art involved real people.
Butwhateveritis, publicdisplaysofalignmentareawayforanetworkuniontonotjust
quietly deliver value for its members (as it should), but to also publicly demonstrate to
the world that it’s a tightly coordinated unit — and worthy of being treated as such.
Proving to the world that your network union can coordinate like an organic nation is
a ﬁrst step in the long process towards eventual diplomatic recognition.
The New Tokenomics is Nation Formation
In the 2000s, most technologists didn’t care that much about how national currencies
were run. The parameter choices of a currency were things only central bankers cared
about. What’s the interest rate? Is it a deﬂationary, inﬂationary, or even demurrage
currency? Which actors have root access to the system and under what circumstances
can they be deplatformed? And so on.
But all those details and more became important for people founding new currencies.
Thus, the concept known as “tokenomics” arose: setting up the ﬁnancial and social
incentives of a new cryptoeconomic community in a user- and organization-aligned
way.
Similarly, all previously obscure details of how nations and states formed are newly
relevant to network union founders. There’s an idea maze for nation formation just as
there is for cryptoeconomics. The ﬁrst question any network union founder needs to
be able to answer is: what is your nation formation strategy?
Path to the Network State
We can now deﬁne a path to the network state:
1.Network union. A wholly digital entity, organized in a social tree structure, that
engages in collective action on behalf of its members. The collective action is key
for building organizational muscle.
2.Network archipelago. A network union that begins acquiring and networking248 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
properties in the physical world. The physical interaction is key for building
trust.
3.Network state. A network archipelago that gains diplomatic recognition from at
least one legacy state. The diplomatic recognition is key for attaining sovereignty.
Of course, the delineation between these categories is fuzzy. For example, a network
archipelagowith100k+people, billionsinannualcollectiveincome, andalargephysical
footprint around the world could be deemed a shadow network state. It would have
more organization than most stateless nations, as it would actually have a state and
land, just not all in one place. All it would lack is recognition.
Slight fuzziness notwithstanding, this is a realistic path from a single network union
founder to something big.
The Bootstrap Recognizer
We call the ﬁrst government to recognize a network state a bootstrap recognizer , named
after the computer science concept of a “bootstrap” system that boots up another.
The bootstrap recognizer is to a network state what El Salvador was to Bitcoin: the
formal acceptance of the new system by the old to form something stronger than either
of them individually.
Each network archipelago that wants to become a network state should have a thesis
on who its bootstrap recognizer is. It will likely be an existing state with many “bi-
nationals” that have formal legal citizenship with their existing nation state but have
mentally migrated to become dual citizens of their new network state. The historical
analog is those who identiﬁed as Israelis or Indians even before their states became
formally independent.
Note that while a bootstrap recognizer will initially have to be a nation state, once
there are many network states of signiﬁcant scale, network states could bootstrap the
recognition of other network states.
Digital Civil Society
Network unions, network societies, and other forms of digital civil society are valuable
endpoints in themselves.
For example, a serious open source project could have an associated network union
that advances the collective interest of (say) a guild of ReactJS programmers, without
any need to buy land.
Or a ﬁtness inﬂuencer could turn their online community into a network archipelago,
replete with gyms around the world, organizing people to get discounted keto-friendly
food.5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 249
You can probably come up with other kinds of structures. The overall idea is to build
digital civil society , allthosecommunityorganizationsthataren’teitherthestateabove
or the isolated individual below, the kind of non-political voluntary associations that
once built America, according to Tocqueville:",1987
164,"I do not wish to speak of those political associations...Here it is a question
only of the associations that are formed in civil life and which have an ob-
ject that is in no way political... Americans of all ages, all conditions, all
minds constantly unite. Not only do they have commercial and industrial
associations in which all take part, but they also have a thousand other
kinds: religious, moral, grave, futile, very general and very particular, im-
mense and very small; Americans use associations to give fêtes, to found
seminaries, to build inns, to raise churches, to distribute books, to send
missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they create hospitals, prisons,
schools. Finally, if it is a question of bringing to light a truth or developing
a sentiment with the support of a great example, they associate. Every-
where that, at the head of a new undertaking, you see the government in
France and a great lord in England, count on it that you will perceive an
association in the United States.
These had vanished by the year 2000, according to Putnam:
Putnam draws on evidence including nearly 500,000 interviews over the
last quarter century to show that we sign fewer petitions, belong to fewer
organizations that meet, know our neighbors less, meet with friends less fre-
quently, and even socialize with our families less often. We’re even bowling
alone.
The network union and network archipelago are ends in themselves. They give us a
roadmap for rebuilding digital civil society, to start doing things together with purpose
and substance online, to move away from the distracting entropy of social media and
the news towards communities of conscious intent. And from these network unions and
network societies, we will form network states.
Recognize Why We Need Recognition
We just described why network states need more than community, and even more
than economic alignment — they need a sense of national consciousness, of collective
purpose, as provided by a network union. Now let’s discuss why we need recognition.
A fun one liner is that crypto made progressives more libertarian and libertarians more
progressive. Progressives discovered that you can build stateless money. Libertari-
ans discovered that you then need to rebuild something much like a state: identity,
reputation, anti-fraud, custody, trust, community, and the like.
We think network states will have a similar dynamic. If they work, they’ll show pro-
gressives a diﬀerent path to political innovation — rather than grinding through a250 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
thankless legacy system, they can use their organizing skills to help start a new one.
But libertarian founders of network unions will similarly need to take a page from the
progressive playbook. While libertarians are drawn to network states for the same
reason they’re interested in competitive government, seasteading, and micronations,
libertarian literature underemphasizes the necessity of diplomatic recognition.
Diplomatic recognition is as essential to a network state as exchange listing and wallet
support is to a cryptocurrency. There are technical aspects to money, but it is also an
inherently social phenomenon. Contrast this to an airplane, which will ﬂy regardless
of what anyone thinks.
Similarly, whileanetworkunioncanget startedwithoneperson, andevenbuylandand
become a network archipelago, to cross the chasm it needs a plan for gaining diplomatic
recognition — to go from “unpopular but feasible” to “popular and important.”
Lack of recognition limits sovereignty. In a sense, diplomatic recognition is a partial,
non-binding, but still meaningful commitment from a legacy state to respect the inter-
nal sovereignty of the new network state, to admit it to the family of nations, to open
up a number of diﬀerent avenues for trade and institutional innovation.
Getting there means the founders of a network union that wants to become a network
state can’t be misanthropic, or even isolationist in mentality. A live and let live men-
tality won’t be enough; you’ll need to recruit people who win and help win. Because
unlike an empire, the end goal of a network state is not world domination; it’s world
recognition.",957
165,"5.3.9 Why Would we Found a Network State?
But why? Why do we need the ability to found a network state? Why can’t we reform
one of the perfectly good countries on the planet?
First, these countries are notperfectly good. Just as it was easier to start a new digital
currency than to reform the Fed, it may be easier to start a new country than to reform
yours.
Second, we want new countries for the same reason we want blank sheets of paper,
fresh plots of land, or new startups: to begin anew without baggage from the old.
And third, for certain kinds of technologies – particularly transformative biotech like
life extension – we need new jurisdictions with fundamentally diﬀerent levels of risk-
tolerance, and clear-eyed consent by all who opt in.
There’s something in it for both engineers and activists, for both the technological
innovator and the political progressive.
Network States for the Technological Innovator
Why should technologists care about politics?5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 251
•The scientiﬁc innovation . Fred Ehrsam wrote that peaceful innovation in gover-
nance is more important for innovation than we realize. After all, the Catholic
Church burned proponents of heliocentrism at the stake; it wouldn’t have in-
vented space shuttles. And the Soviet Union banned photocopiers; it wouldn’t
have allowed the internet. Today, we see that San Francisco is banning everything
from scooters to straws, but what we don’t see is what didn’t even make it out
of the garage.
•The physical world . The state controls the physical world. With suﬃcient con-
sent, any law can be changed, and any regulation can be sunset, or reinvented.
This is how “bits” unlock innovation in “atoms”: we form opt-in communities
online to unlock innovation oﬄine.
•The economics . Money isn’t everything, but it’s crucial to making something
sustainable. we know that antiquated taxi regulations held back one hundred
billion dollars in the form of Uber/Lyft/Grab/Didi, that ﬁnancial regulations
held back one trillion dollars in the form of Bitcoin/Ethereum, and communism
held back the Chinese people to the tune of ten trillion dollars (namely the entire
Chinese economy).
•The data . Technologists can think of new opt-in states as experiments. Just
as the ability to start new currencies moved us from observational to empirical
macroeconomics, the ability to start new countries takes us from the realm of
political science — the study of what is — to political technology, the engineering
of what can be.
•The platform . We can think of the state as our most important platform, more
important even than Apple or Amazon, the place where much of our data and
lives are hosted. Right now, we can’t upgrade the state. What if we could?
•The ethics . Just as many kinds of things become easier to build in the presence of
a cooperative centralized server, many more things become easier in the presence
ofacooperativecentralizedstate. Anetworkstatebuildsasocietywhereeveryone
has broad support for technological innovation. You want a country where people
cheer Mission Control, not boo Musk and Bezos, and now we can build one.
Of course, network states aren’t for every technologist. If you care mainly about
compilers or programming languages, you can get by under the current dispensation.
And if all you want is a steady paycheck at Big Tech, a network state is not for you.
But if you care about accelerating innovation in the physical world, we ﬁnally have an
answer.
Network States for the Political Progressive
Why should political progressives want to start new cities and countries?
•If you’re a young politician, perhaps you don’t want to wait till you’re 70 years
old to pay your dues and make your mark.252 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
•If you’re a community organizer, network unions give you a digital community to
organize, sometimes against states and corporations, but also for the beneﬁt of
individual members’ open source projects, businesses, and consulting gigs.
•If you’re an advocate for a stateless nation like the Catalonians or the Kurds,
network unions and eventually network states give a new path to recognition.
•If you’re a policy wonk, network states allow you to run ethical experiments on
policy, with opt-in participants that are as interested in governance innovation as
you are. You can experiment with digital democracy, new forms of government,
or anything you think interesting.
•If you’re an idealist, network states bring back the voluntary communes of the
mid-1800s America, where people could opt-in to build their own vision of utopia.
•If you’re an anarchist, network unions oﬀer a vision of horizontal collaboration
in the absence of traditional governance and without coercion.
•If you’re an urban planner, network societies allow you to build support and
amass funding to crowdfund your vision of the good.
In short, whether you want to experiment with reforms or entirely new forms of gov-
ernment, there’s likely something in the concept of network unions, network societies,
and network states that will suit you.
Moreover, these structures are far more democratic than the coercive governance struc-
tures of the legacy system, because they’re all opt-in. 100% of members of a network
union or network state have chosen to be there, rather than 51% imposing their will
on a reluctant 49%. Network states are models for 100% democracy, not merely 51%
democracy.
With that said, the concept of a network state isn’t a panacea. Many political progres-
sives will be attracted to existing governments for one very simple reason: they already
exist, and already have socioeconomic power. You don’t need to build everything from
scratch.
But for the idealists and the ambitious who are excited about the possibility of doing
exactly that, there’s nothing more politically interesting than a new state.",1393
166,"5.3.10 How does a Network State Expand and Contract?
Network states give a wholly new way for states to expand. They can grow peacefully
in the digital world rather than violently in the physical world. The network state
formation process can begin with a single founding inﬂuencer and scale to a million
person physical community.
We can break out the underlying vectors of growth as follows:
1.Demographically. Most obviously, a network state (or a predecessor entity like a
network union or network archipelago) can grow its userbase through recruitment5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 253
and reproduction. For the latter, the growing state will need some policy to
recognize the new family members as netizens, such as jus sanguinis .
2.Geographically. As the citizenry of a network state grows, it can start crowd-
funding more territory in the physical world. This is a peaceful mechanism for
territorialexpansion. Notethatthesepurchasesneednotbefromsovereignstates,
though they may ultimately be.
3.Digitally. A complement to geographical growth is digital growth: more domain
names, crypto usernames, and social media handles under ownership of netizens
and the network state.
4.Economically. The people of a network state will earn income and invest on
chain. Those numbers, or an aggregate thereof, can be made public to the world
via crypto oracles, thereby showing cryptographically provable growth in GDP
and net worth.
5.Ideologically. Because a network state is fundamentally a proposition nation, it’s
constantly evangelizing its beliefs. But unlike a traditional nation state’s soft
power, which is not directly tied to immigration policy, here the evangelism is
explicitly connected to recruiting.
6.Technologically . Why call this point out separately? Technological progress is a
deﬁning feature of a network state to an even greater degree than its nation state
predecessor. A network state understands that in the absence of innovation, its
at-will citizens will leave for more advanced jurisdictions in the same way people
left Blockbuster for Netﬂix. But because technological innovation is non-zero
sum, the relentless competitive pressure for mobile citizens means the network
state system is positive-sum , which is very unlike the nation state system’s zero-
sumstruggle for territory.
The network state system is not about the battle for borders, but for backlinks (in a
generalized sense). Many of the things that states traditionally fought over can now
be abstracted and turned into an economic game. This is a step forward, for the same
reason that it was a huge advance whenever nations resorted to trade rather than
conquest to gain access to each others’ natural resources.
What underpins the new dynamic of network states is the intrinsic lack of scarcity of
digital territory, the return of unclaimed land and terra nullius , the reopened frontier.
As we discuss later on, it was this frontier, this room for experimentation, that built
America in the ﬁrst place. Voice was important, but so was choice.
Thus, just like a tech company or a social network, a network state provides a smooth
path from a single person with a computer and no other resources to a million person
global network. Constant, nonviolent growth is now possible — not by conquest or
coercion, but through volition and innovation.254 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES",759
167,"5.3.11 What is not a Network State?
As with nation states, it’s useful to give examples that are adjacent to network states,
but don’t quite ﬁt. First, we’ll go over conceptually far away examples; then, a number
ofstructuresthataremuchcloser, whichcanbecomenetworkunions, networksocieties,
and network states.
First, let’s discuss some things that are actually quite far away from network states,
but that are often discussed in the same breath. Each has some important similarities
(a social network, a global physical footprint) but lacks a key dimension.
1.Your startup. As discussed earlier, don’t go around saying that you’re starting a
network state. Say that you’re starting a network union, and build up a commu-
nity that’s capable of doing collective actions online. Then crowdfund territory
and turn your online community into a network archipelago with physical pres-
ence. Finally, if all the stars align, gain diplomatic recognition and thendeclare
your society a network state. I know this might seem a bit like the Marxist insis-
tence on the diﬀerence between socialism and communism, but the counterpoint
is that nations haveacquired land and gained diplomatic recognition before —
and we note that it’s important when they do. They just haven’t done it in quite
this way, with this progression. That’s why we want separate terms for network
union, network archipelago, and network state.
2.Twitter, the social network. Twitter is a babble of competing and hostile clans,
many of whom don’t speak the same language or (even more importantly) share
the same values. In our terminology, it is very much an N-network, not a 1-
network. I’m not sure how many true national networks there are within Twitter
(it’d depend on the parameters of our computational algorithm for national dis-
tillation), but for the US alone it’s at least two — arguably much more.
3.WeWork, the coworking space. WeWork’s woes notwithstanding, they built a
useful product. But it was more like a utility than a true community, more like
a Starbucks than a small town. Think about it: in a coworking space, the couch
might be leather and the coﬀee might be decent, but you don’t leave your laptop
out of sight because you don’t know anyone there. You need to get a conference
room to speak freely, you need to use a privacy screen; in general, it’s not a
high-trust zone. That’s not a true community.
4.Google, the company. Google the company has a large global physical footprint
and an even larger digital footprint, with millions of square meters and billions
of users around the world. It also makes many digital governance decisions per
day. But its usersaren’t a community, and they don’t really think of Google
as a legitimate government. Conversely, while its employees do call themselves
Googlers, they think of their employer as a company rather than a country in
embryo. And they aren’t really at the stage where they want to work hard on
building a new nation.5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 255
5.Bitcoin, the crypto protocol. There are hundreds of millions of holders of Bit-
coin worldwide, and the ideas of Satoshi are core to modern thinking on digital
governance. Nevertheless, Bitcoin does only one thing: facilitate uncensorable
transactions in Bitcoin. It can be thought of as a meta-government, because it
constrainsnetworkandnationstatesalike, butitissilentonthe1000otherthings
that even a minarchist agrees a government should do. Moreover, while there is
somecommonalityoffeelingbetweenBitcoinholders, therealsostrongdiﬀerences
— Maximalists are only a subset of the community. Overall, the similarity be-
tween Bitcoin holders is probably more at the level of English-language speakers
than, say, Japanese-language speakers. They can understand each other, or at
least understand each others’ premises, but they don’t all have the same vision
of the good. In short, a digital currency is a prerequisite for a digital country,
but they are not equivalent.
Next, let’s go through some things which are close to a network state, in the sense
that they can be converted to an (all-digital) network union or a (digital + physical)
network archipelago, but are not quite there.
1.A political party. A political party is close. It has a shared community, it has a
sense of self and non-self, it has a vision for governance should it gain power, and
so on. What it doesn’t have is a “shadow” structure where it can administrate
the lives of its members even when it is outside of the formal government. It also
typically doesn’t own property, or formally facilitate the mingling and migration
of party members. But all that can be done 24/7 withoutneeding to win the vote
in a general election, and network unionization may become an interesting route
for any minority party.
2.A network of hacker houses. If all the people in this network know each other well
enough to leave their laptop on a couch with the conﬁdence that no one will steal
it, then it’s a high-enough trust community to be a proto network archipelago.
It may need to layer on governance.
3.r/keto.A subreddit for diet, like r/keto, has a community, a governance struc-
ture via moderators, and a shared purpose. Don’t laugh — strict dietary rules
have been important for religious practice for centuries, and they are an excellent
shibboleth for group membership. To build a network union, the members of
r/ketowould need some kind of collective action that members do together (like
bulk purchases of keto food or reviews of keto books). To turn it into a network
archipelago, they might need to start keto clubs and restaurants and link them
together (networked physical territory). Their vision might stop at a cohesive
society, instead of an all-encompassing state; their network archipelago might be
partof a network state that rejected not just the USDA Food Pyramid, but also
the US Fed pyramid schemes.
4.An inﬂuencer or CEO’s following. A popular content creator or CEO is a good
candidate for pulling together a network union. There’s alignment, there’s an
existing group, and there’s leadership. But they’d need to ﬁgure out a purpose256 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
for their community (if an inﬂuencer) or a purpose beyond the merely commer-
cial (if a CEO). That’ll be easier for activists and technologists, and harder for
entertainers and pure salesmen.
5.DAOs and NFT communities. As noted earlier, these are also quite close to being
network unions, but they need to ensure they have members who are there for
the long-term cause rather than for the short-term pump. If so, they can start
pulling together communities of purpose towards collective action.
6.A city state. This bears mentioning too: a city state is nota network state.
Why? Because a city state is concentrated in one location, and can be invaded
by a stronger power, while a network state is geographically decentralized and
encrypted. It can’t easily be physically invaded without going after all of its
territories (many of which may be unlisted, or literal single person apartments),
which would be a politically fraught multi-jurisdiction campaign. And it can’t be
digitally invaded without breaking the encryption that protects its constituent
blockchain. So a network state can be thought of as a v3 of the state, that
combines aspects of the scaled nation states of the 20th century with the nimble
citystatesthatprecededthem. Ithasthepotentialmassivescaleanddefensibility
of a billion person nation state, while preserving the innovation and consent of
a small opt-in community. It’s similar to how Bitcoin combines aspects of gold
(v1) with Fedwire (v2) to produce a v3 system.
In short, you need a strong community to even have a chance of building a network
state. Twitter at large is not it, Google Inc is not it, Bitcoin is not it — these lack
either a single self-conscious nation, a functional state, or both.
A political party is closer. A very tight-knit NFT community or inﬂuencer/CEO fol-",1983
168,"lowing is even closer. To get on the path to network states, they would ﬁrst build
digital strength via the network union, then add physical territory via the network
archipelago, and then gain diplomatic recognition in a true network state.",54
169,"5.3.12 WhatTechnologicalDevelopmentsenableNetworkStates?
Venture capitalists are fond of asking the “why now” question to entrepreneurs. Why
now? Why can we contemplate founding network states today, and not 5 or 10 or 20
years ago? What’s changed in the world?
Well, a lot has changed. Here are some of the key enablers of the network state:
1.The Internet is to the USA as the Americas were to the UK. Of course, the
internet enables the whole thing. But the manner in which it enables the network
state is worth discussing. Think of the internet as a cloud continent, a sort of
digital Atlantis that came down from the heavens sometime around 1991 and
has parked itself over the middle of the Paciﬁc Ocean. Every day, everyone who
spends (say) 8 hours online is doing the equivalent of ﬂying up to this cloud from
Menlo Park or Tokyo for business or pleasure, and then ﬂying back down. While5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 257
there, they see new things, meet new people, and sometimes ﬁght them. So far,
what we’ve described is much like the settling of the Americas from 1492-1890,
but there are at least two key diﬀerences. First, of course, the cloud had no
pre-existing people. Second, unlike the vast-but-ﬁnite soil of America, you can
create new digital land ad inﬁnitum in the cloud. As we discuss later on, that
reopening of the frontier changes everything. It means that the Internet is to the
USA as the Americas were to the UK: a wide open territory that ultimately gave
birth to new states and ways of thinking.
2.Bitcoin constrains legacy states. Bitcoin is the next most important prerequi-
site for the network state. As a government of governments, it guarantees the
sovereignty of both the individual citizen andthe network state itself. Neither
can have their funds stolen by each other, or by a hostile third party. Bitcoin has
also created new fortunes outside the ﬁat system, demonstrated that institutions
as powerful as the Fed canbe replaced in a few decades, and pioneered an entirely
new way of designing web services in a decentralized manner.
3.Web3 enables new chains, decentralized identities, and censorship-resistant com-
munities. With web3, we can set up a blockchain as the backbone of each network
state. This is the community chain that the state-appointed leadership has root
over, as a complement to a public chain like Bitcoin or Ethereum that serves as
an external check and balance. We can create decentralized identities similar to
ENS and SNS to serve as digital passports for the network state, deﬁning citizen-
ship on the basis of single sign-on access to network state services. And we can
allow not just censorship-resistant communication, but censorship-resistant com-
munities, voluntary gatherings of people that can exist outside the interference
or surveillance of legacy states.
4.Remote and Starlink open up the map. The moment something is put on the
internet, it becomes remote friendly. And everything is going on the internet.
Moreover, remote doesn’t just mean around the corner, it means around the
world. Starlink, and satellite broadband more generally, powers up remote fur-
ther, by making huge swaths of the map newly economically feasible. Nothing
now prevents a suﬃciently motivated digital community from setting up their
own Burning Man equivalent in the middle of nowhere, except this time for per-
manent habitation, and with an eye towards incorporating formal towns and and
cities. This complements our earlier point: through the internet, we’re reopening
the frontier, and making previously godforsaken areas of the map much more
attractive. Unlike past eras, you don’t no longer need to be near a port or mine
to build a city; you just need to be near an internet connection.
5.Mobile makes us more mobile. Law is a function of latitude and longitude,
so if you can easily change your latitude and longitude, you can change the
law under which you live. That’s why the most important long-term conse-
quence of the smartphone is Tiebout sorting. That is, all of the assumptions in
Charles Tiebout’s famous paper from the 50s become feasible with suﬃciently258 CHAPTER 5. FROM NATION STATES TO NETWORK STATES
advanced phones. With digital nomad search engines like ‘teleport.org‘ and ‘no-
madlist.com‘, some people can choose who they want, while others move where
they like.
6.VR builds a capital in the cloud, AR mirrors it on the land. Virtual reality (and
more generally the open metaverse) are yet another way in which the obligate
ties to the land are being cut. We can now build full castles in the sky, and then
with augmented reality project them onto the earth. For a network archipelago
or network state, that’s a powerful way to link distributed physical territories
together into a coherent whole.
7.Social disintermediated the media. Again, this one is almost too obvious, but so-
cial media allowed anyone to build a massive following online, it disintermediated
the legacy media, and (in combination with messaging apps and related tools) it
made one’s contacts inﬁnitely pportable.
8.GAFAM showed us what’s possible, startup/VC showed us how. None of the web3
world would be possible without the web2 and web1 worlds. Google showed us
whatcouldbedonefromagarage. Facebookshoweduswhatcouldbebuiltfroma
dorm room. The entire startup industry has shown us that big things can be done
on a shoestring. Without the trillion dollar companies and billion user networks,
we wouldn’t feel like we could build million person network states. In particular,
as Gilles Babinet observed, once you see partial transfers of sovereignty in the
digital world, you know more may come. From the postal service to Gmail, from
taxi medallions to Uber and Lyft, from the banks to Bitcoin, from the maps to
Google Maps, from the FCC to WhatsApp, from the courts to moderators, legacy
states control less and digital networks control more. Of course, the former lack
technical competence and the latter lack democratic legitimacy, which is exactly
the problem the network state solves.
Next, here are a few things that will be helpful to network states, but are not essential
for their construction:
1.Land becomes elastic. As Will Rogers once said, “buy land, they ain’t making
any more of it.” Or are they? Seasteaders and the artiﬁcial islands built in
Dubai show that land supply is perhaps more elastic than we think. We also
know you can build cruise ships. So it’s possible that we could start reopening
the frontier physically as well, not just digitally. This isn’t incompatible with
Georgism, which argues that the inelastic supply of land means there should be
only one tax, a land tax; it just means the supply is not perfectly inelastic. If
you combine the two concepts, if more value creation goes online and away from
the physical world, you get the idea of being able to (a) print more land, and
(b) partially commoditize existing nation states as providers of land and natural
resources.
2.Telepresence changes the nature of immigration . The next step after simply
projecting in an AR avatar is to dial up a robot on the other side of the world and5.3. ON NETWORK STATES 259
start walking around. This should in theory be feasible by combining (a) Boston
Dynamics’ legged robots, (b) DoubleRobotics’ telepresent iPads on wheels, (c) an
Oculus Quest headset, and (d) an omnidirectional treadmill. That combination
of devices could furnish immersive control of a humanoid robot anywhere on the
globe.
3.Bits reopen innovation in atoms. Innovation in areas like biomedicine, robotics,
and energy is not upstream of the network state, it’s downstream of it. The
network state solves the problem posed by Thiel, Cowen, and J Storrs Hall.
We’re using bits to reopen innovation in atoms, because innovation in atoms has
been blocked by regulations, which are in turn created by the US establishment
and exported all over the world through harmonization. The network state uses
digital technology to gain suﬃcient consent in the cloud to build a community,
crowdfund territory, and eventually gain recognition as a sovereign polity. Once
we do so, we can return innovation to the physical world.
